0,Avatar,JAKE,"They can fix a spinal, if you've got the money. But not on vet benefits, not in this economy."
1,Avatar,JAKE,I became a Marine for the hardship. To be hammered on the anvil of life. I told myself I could pass any test a man can pass.
2,Avatar,JAKE,Let's get it straight up front. I don't want your pity. I know the world's a cold-ass bitch.
3,Avatar,JAKE,"You want a fair deal, you're on the wrong planet. The strong prey on the weak."
4,Avatar,JAKE,It's just the way things are. And nobody does a damn thing.
5,Avatar,JAKE,All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life was a single thing worth fighting for. CUT TO:
6,Avatar,JAKE,I hope you realize you've just lost a customer!
7,Avatar,JAKE,Candy ass bitch.
8,Avatar,JAKE,If it ain't rainin' we ain't trainin'!
9,Avatar,JAKE,Step off. You're ruinin' my good mood.
10,Avatar,JAKE,"The strong prey on the weak. A guy with a knife took all Tommy would ever be, for the paper in his wallet."
11,Avatar,JAKE,"Jesus, Tommy."
12,Avatar,JAKE,The Suits' concern was touching.
13,Avatar,JAKE,"The egghead and the jarhead. Tommy was the scientist, not me. He was the one who wanted to get shot light years out into space to find the answers."
14,Avatar,JAKE,Me -- I was just another dumb grunt gettin' sent someplace I was gonna regret.
15,Avatar,JAKE,Are we there?
16,Avatar,JAKE,What're you two limpdicks starin' at?
17,Avatar,JAKE,Nothing like an old-school safety brief to put your mind at ease. CUT TO:
18,Avatar,JAKE,Yeah.
19,Avatar,JAKE,That's why I'm here.
20,Avatar,JAKE,Damn. They got big.
21,Avatar,JAKE,It looks like him.
22,Avatar,JAKE,The idea is -- every driver is matched to his own avatar --
23,Avatar,JAKE,"-- so their nervous systems are in tune. Or something. Which is why they offered me this gig, because I can link with Tommy's avatar, which was insanely expensive. Is this right? I just say whatever in these videologs?"
24,Avatar,JAKE,"Right. So, whatever. Here I am. Doing science. Never been in a lab before."
25,Avatar,GRACE,Who's got my goddamn cigarette?!
26,Avatar,GRACE,Norm. I hear good things about you. How's your Na'vi?
27,Avatar,GRACE,Not bad. You sound a little formal.
28,Avatar,GRACE,"Yeah, yeah, I know who you are, and I don't need you. I need your brother. You know -- the PhD who trained three years for this mission."
29,Avatar,JAKE,He's dead. I know it's a big inconvenience to everyone.
30,Avatar,GRACE,How much lab training have you had? Ever run a gas chromatograph?
31,Avatar,JAKE,No.
32,Avatar,GRACE,Any actual lab work at all?
33,Avatar,JAKE,High school chemistry. But I ditched.
34,Avatar,GRACE,You see? You see? They're pissing on us without even the courtesy of calling it rain. I'm going to Selfridge.
35,Avatar,GRACE,"Parker, I used to think it was benign neglect, but now I see you're intentionally screwing us."
36,Avatar,GRACE,"I need a research assistant, not some jarhead dropout."
37,Avatar,GRACE,Lucky? How is this in any way lucky?
38,Avatar,GRACE,The last thing I need is another trigger happy asshole out there!
39,Avatar,GRACE,That tends to happen when you use machine guns on them.
40,Avatar,GRACE,How much link time have you logged?
41,Avatar,JAKE,Like -- an hour.
42,Avatar,GRACE,Tell me you're joking.
43,Avatar,JAKE,Don't! I got this.
44,Avatar,GRACE,"So you just figured you'd come out here to the most hostile environment known to man, with no training of any kind, and see how it went? What was going through your head?"
45,Avatar,JAKE,Maybe I was just tired of doctors telling me what I couldn't do.
46,Avatar,GRACE,Relax and let your mind go blank. That shouldn't be hard for you.
47,Avatar,JAKE,Kiss the darkest part of my lily white --
48,Avatar,GRACE,"Go figure. Alright, I'm going in."
49,Avatar,GRACE,Hey Marine!
50,Avatar,JAKE,Grace?
51,Avatar,GRACE,"Well who'd you expect, numbnuts? Think fast!"
52,Avatar,GRACE,Motor control is looking good.
53,Avatar,JAKE,That's kinda freaky.
54,Avatar,GRACE,Lights out amigos. See ya' at dinner.
55,Avatar,GRACE,Damn. Same old sack a' bones.
56,Avatar,JAKE,You guys're packing some heavy ordinance.
57,Avatar,JAKE,"Yeah, no problem."
58,Avatar,JAKE,I figured -- just another hellhole.
59,Avatar,JAKE,"That sounds real good, Colonel. So -- am I still with Augustine?"
60,Avatar,GRACE,Start calibrating. We're on the flight line in ten minutes.
61,Avatar,GRACE,What did Atilla want?
62,Avatar,JAKE,Just Marines comparin' tattoos.
63,Avatar,GRACE,"Yeah. Well, listen to me, Marine --"
64,Avatar,GRACE,"-- you're driving an avatar, now. That means you're in my world, got it?"
65,Avatar,JAKE,Got it.
66,Avatar,GRACE,"That son of a bitch has screwed up this program enough. All this -- -- exists so we can go out there and build a bridge of trust to these people, who could teach us so much. But thanks to Quaritch and his thugs the Na'vi won't even talk to us anymore."
67,Avatar,JAKE,Then how's this supposed to work?
68,Avatar,GRACE,"We have a new face. You're fluent, you've studied the culture. You're non-threatening. The ones we know best -- the Omaticaya clan -- may give you a chance. Maybe you can get them back to the table before things go tits-up for good."
69,Avatar,JAKE,How do we contact them?
70,Avatar,GRACE,"We don't. They contact us. If they see us taking our samples, treating the forest with respect -- Not trampling everything in sight -- they may reach out to us."
71,Avatar,JAKE,Or they may skin us and make a drum.
72,Avatar,GRACE,Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking.
73,Avatar,GRACE,"Looks like a bull, six cows and some juveniles."
74,Avatar,GRACE,Stay with the ship. One idiot with a gun's enough.
75,Avatar,GRACE,"Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous."
76,Avatar,GRACE,I'm sure they're watching us right now.
77,Avatar,GRACE,"The kids were so bright, so eager to learn... they picked up English faster than I could teach it to them."
78,Avatar,GRACE,"Bring the soil probe -- right there, yellow case."
79,Avatar,GRACE,The stingbats knock them off. I guess I always hope somebody will come back and read them.
80,Avatar,GRACE,The Na'vi learned as much about us as they needed to know.
81,Avatar,JAKE,What happened here?
82,Avatar,GRACE,Are you going to help with this gear? We've got a lot to do.
83,Avatar,GRACE,"See, right here where the roots of the two trees interact."
84,Avatar,GRACE,Don't shoot. You'll piss it off.
85,Avatar,JAKE,It's already pissed off!
86,Avatar,GRACE,"Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me."
87,Avatar,GRACE,"It's a territorial threat display. Do not run, or he'll charge."
88,Avatar,JAKE,What do I do?
89,Avatar,GRACE,Hold your ground!
90,Avatar,JAKE,Oh yeah! Who's bad?! That's right.
91,Avatar,JAKE,"That's what I'm talkin' about, bitch!"
92,Avatar,JAKE,That's right motherf--
93,Avatar,JAKE,"What about this one? Run, don't run? What?"
94,Avatar,GRACE,Run. Definitely RUN!
95,Avatar,GRACE,Shit.
96,Avatar,GRACE,He's not going to make it till morning.
97,Avatar,JAKE,I don't have all goddamn night! Come on! Come on!
98,Avatar,JAKE,"Wait, don't --"
99,Avatar,JAKE,"Look, um, I know you probably don't understand this. But -- thanks. Thank you. I owe you."
100,Avatar,JAKE,I would have been screwed if you hadn't come along --
101,Avatar,JAKE,"Hey, wait. Wait! Where you goin'?"
102,Avatar,JAKE,Slow down a second will you. I just want to thank you for killing those --
103,Avatar,JAKE,"Okay, I'm sorry. Whatever I did -- I'm sorry."
104,Avatar,JAKE,They attacked me. How'm I the bad guy HERE--
105,Avatar,JAKE,"Okay, fine, you love your little forest friends. So why not just let them kill my ass? What's the thinking?"
106,Avatar,JAKE,"Yes, why save me?"
107,Avatar,JAKE,"If I'm so ignorant, maybe you should teach me."
108,Avatar,JAKE,Whooaa.
109,Avatar,JAKE,"Then teach me to ""see."""
110,Avatar,JAKE,"Hey, slow down. Look, I think we just got off on the wrong foot and --"
111,Avatar,JAKE,--you just have to get to know me. I'm Jake. Jake Sull--
112,Avatar,JAKE,Whooaaa -- shit!
113,Avatar,JAKE,I need your help.
114,Avatar,JAKE,So take me with you.
115,Avatar,JAKE,What?
116,Avatar,JAKE,What are they?
117,Avatar,JAKE,What was that all about?
118,Avatar,JAKE,What's your name?
119,Avatar,JAKE,What's going on?
120,Avatar,JAKE,"Your father!? Uh, good to meet you, sir."
121,Avatar,JAKE,Who's Eywa?
122,Avatar,JAKE,Jake Sully.
123,Avatar,JAKE,I came to learn.
124,Avatar,JAKE,"My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask Doctor Augustine. I'm no scientist."
125,Avatar,JAKE,"I don't know. I was a Marine -- uh, a warrior. Of the Jarhead clan."
126,Avatar,JAKE,What's going on? What are they saying?
127,Avatar,JAKE,"So it's all good, right? You and me --"
128,Avatar,JAKE,Don't get up.
129,Avatar,JAKE,You never told me your name.
130,Avatar,JAKE,"Okay, again, a whole lot slower."
131,Avatar,JAKE,Nay-TEE-ree. That's nice. Nay-TEE-ree.
132,Avatar,JAKE,Your mom likes me. I can tell.
133,Avatar,JAKE,These rock. What are they?
134,Avatar,JAKE,That's some damn fine teylu. That's like grandma's teylu.
135,Avatar,GRACE,"Come on back, kid, that's it."
136,Avatar,JAKE,Wha --? Oh.
137,Avatar,GRACE,"Damn, you were dug in like a tick. Is the avatar safe?"
138,Avatar,JAKE,"Yeah, Doc -- and you are not going to believe where I am. CUT TO:"
139,Avatar,GRACE,-- so the kid's out there one night and he's got the Queen Bitch herself offering him the spare room and the car keys. Unbelievable.
140,Avatar,JAKE,It's not something you can teach.
141,Avatar,GRACE,"For reasons I cannot fathom, the Omaticaya have chosen you. God help us all. CUT TO:"
142,Avatar,JAKE,Yeah. They want to study me. See if I can learn to be one of them.
143,Avatar,JAKE,Does Augustine know about this?
144,Avatar,JAKE,So -- who talks them into moving?
145,Avatar,JAKE,What if they won't go?
146,Avatar,JAKE,I'm on it. CUT TO:
147,Avatar,JAKE,Tsu'tey. Mo'at. Eytukan.
148,Avatar,GRACE,He's the clan leader -- -- but she's the spiritual leader. Like a shaman.
149,Avatar,JAKE,Got it. So who's this Eywa?
150,Avatar,JAKE,Who's got a date with the chief's daughter?
151,Avatar,GRACE,"Knock it off. Jesus, it's like kindergarten around here."
152,Avatar,GRACE,Neytiri was my best student. She and her sister Silwanin. Just amazing girls.
153,Avatar,JAKE,I didn't meet the sister.
154,Avatar,GRACE,"No, she's dead. Okay, let's go -- village life starts early."
155,Avatar,GRACE,Don't do anything unusually stupid.
156,Avatar,JAKE,Forward.
157,Avatar,JAKE,I knew this guy could speak English.
158,Avatar,JAKE,"You've got outer columns, then a secondary ring here, and an inner ring. Then a core structure, it's like a spiral, that's how they move up and down."
159,Avatar,JAKE,Roger that.
160,Avatar,GRACE,I'm not about to let Quaritch and Selfridge micro-manage this thing. We're going up into the mountains.
161,Avatar,GRACE,That's right.
162,Avatar,GRACE,See these magnetic formations. We're getting close.
163,Avatar,GRACE,Yup. We're in the flux vortex.
164,Avatar,JAKE,"Yeah, so what does hold them up? Grace explained it to me -- some kind of maglev effect because unobtanium is a superconductor, or something. At least somebody understands it. Just not me. CUT TO:"
165,Avatar,GRACE,"Jake, take number two, it's the least glitchy. Norm, I need you to operate Jake's link."
166,Avatar,JAKE,Hey. You got a problem?
167,Avatar,GRACE,"It's not our choice, Norm."
168,Avatar,GRACE,He can't go far.
169,Avatar,GRACE,Let's get you in. CUT TO:
170,Avatar,JAKE,Holy shit.
171,Avatar,JAKE,When?
172,Avatar,JAKE,Do I have to do this? I need some rack.
173,Avatar,GRACE,"No -- now, when it's fresh."
174,Avatar,JAKE,"Yeah, yeah. The days are starting to blur together. The language is a bitch, but I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon. Repetition."
175,Avatar,JAKE,Seyri.
176,Avatar,JAKE,"Ontu, mikyun, nari."
177,Avatar,JAKE,Neytiri thinks I'm some kind of retard.
178,Avatar,JAKE,Norm's attitude has improved lately.
179,Avatar,JAKE,Ireiyo.
180,Avatar,JAKE,"It's good he's back on board, but he thinks I'm a retard too."
181,Avatar,JAKE,My feet are getting tougher. I can run farther every day.
182,Avatar,JAKE,I have to trust my body to know what to do. With Neytiri it's learn fast or die.
183,Avatar,JAKE,I sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and Grace a hall pass. Now Grace even makes me coffee before link every morning.
184,Avatar,GRACE,"I See you, Neytiri Mo'at'ite."
185,Avatar,JAKE,"I'm learning to read the trails, the tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest scents and sounds."
186,Avatar,JAKE,Sometimes I have no idea what she's talking about.
187,Avatar,JAKE,It's been a month and I'm still not allowed to make a kill. She says the forest hasn't given permission.
188,Avatar,JAKE,There's a lot of crap like that. She's always going on about the flow of energy-- the spirits of the animals and what not --
189,Avatar,JAKE,I just hope this treehugger shit isn't on the final.
190,Avatar,GRACE,This isn't just about eye-hand coordination out there. You need to listen to what she says. Try to see the forest through their eyes.
191,Avatar,JAKE,"Excuse me -- this is my video-log here, okay?"
192,Avatar,JAKE,"Everything is backwards now. Like out there is the true world, and in here is the dream."
193,Avatar,JAKE,"I See you Brother, and thank you. Your spirit goes with Eywa, your body stays behind to become part of the People."
194,Avatar,GRACE,You're still losing weight. Here --
195,Avatar,JAKE,I made a kill today. We ate it. I know where that meal came from.
196,Avatar,GRACE,Other body. You need to take care of this body.
197,Avatar,JAKE,Yeah yeah.
198,Avatar,GRACE,"Jake, I'm serious -- you look like crap. You're burning too hard."
199,Avatar,JAKE,"Get rid of this shit, then you can lecture me."
200,Avatar,GRACE,"I'm telling you, as your boss and someone who might even consider being a friend someday, to take some down time."
201,Avatar,JAKE,Not now. Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya.
202,Avatar,GRACE,Yeah -- you're gonna go ride a banshee. Or die trying.
203,Avatar,JAKE,"That's right, Grace. This is what I've been working for."
204,Avatar,GRACE,"And this is your check up from the neck up, Marine. You're getting in way too deep. Trust me, I learned the hard way."
205,Avatar,JAKE,What did happen at the school?
206,Avatar,GRACE,Neytiri's sister -- Sylwanin -- stopped coming to school. She was angry about the clear-cutting.
207,Avatar,GRACE,"One day, she and a couple of other young hunters came running in, all painted up -- they'd set a bulldozer on fire -- I guess they thought I could protect them."
208,Avatar,GRACE,The troopers pursued them to the schoolhouse.
209,Avatar,GRACE,"They killed Sylwanin in the doorway. Right in front of Neytiri. Then shot the others. I got most of the kids out, before they shot me."
210,Avatar,JAKE,Jesus.
211,Avatar,GRACE,Yeah.
212,Avatar,GRACE,A scientist stays objective -- we can not be ruled by emotion. But I poured ten years of my life into that school. They called me sa'atenuk. Mother. That kind of pain reaches back through the link.
213,Avatar,GRACE,It's a job. Learn what you can -- but don't get attached.
214,Avatar,GRACE,"It's not our world, Jake. And we can't stop what's coming. CUT TO:"
215,Avatar,JAKE,Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway to heaven. It's the test every young hunter has to pass.
216,Avatar,JAKE,We doin' this?
217,Avatar,JAKE,How will I know if he chooses me?
218,Avatar,JAKE,Outstanding.
219,Avatar,JAKE,Let's dance.
220,Avatar,JAKE,That's right! You're mine.
221,Avatar,JAKE,Heeeyyyaaaah!
222,Avatar,JAKE,Shut the hell up!!
223,Avatar,JAKE,Level out! Fly straight!
224,Avatar,JAKE,I may not be much of a horse guy. But I was born to do this.
225,Avatar,GRACE,"The Great Leonopteryx is the apex aerial predator. Not only rare, but the sightings tend not to get reported."
226,Avatar,JAKE,The People call it Toruk.
227,Avatar,JAKE,Last one you ever see.
228,Avatar,JAKE,That's it.
229,Avatar,GRACE,Vitraya Ramunong -- The Well of Souls. It's their most sacred place.
230,Avatar,GRACE,"Something big is going on in there, biologically. I'd die to get samples, but outsiders are strictly forbidden."
231,Avatar,JAKE,"Hey, guys. CUT TO:"
232,Avatar,JAKE,That's a long time.
233,Avatar,GRACE,Watch that stuff. It'll knock you into next week.
234,Avatar,JAKE,Sorry.
235,Avatar,JAKE,It's hard to put in words the deep connection the People have to the forest.
236,Avatar,JAKE,They see a network of energy that flows through all living things. They know that all energy is only borrowed--
237,Avatar,JAKE,-- and one day you have to give it back.
238,Avatar,JAKE,Hard to believe it's only been three months.
239,Avatar,JAKE,I can barely remember my old life. I'm not sure who I am anymore. CUT TO:
240,Avatar,JAKE,You called us back to report -- you want to hear it or not?
241,Avatar,GRACE,"Jake is making incredible progress, years worth in just a few months. But -- we need more time."
242,Avatar,GRACE,"Parker, it's their ancestral home. They've lived there since before human history began. You can spare them a few more weeks."
243,Avatar,JAKE,No. I can do this.
244,Avatar,JAKE,I've gotta finish this thing. There's one more test -- the Dream Hunt. It's the final stage of becoming a man. Then I'm one of them. They'll trust what I say...
245,Avatar,JAKE,... and I can negotiate the terms of their relocation.
246,Avatar,GRACE,"Jake, I can't allow this. You're just not strong enough."
247,Avatar,JAKE,It's the last door -- I'm going through it. You can help me or get out of the way.
248,Avatar,GRACE,Will you listen to me? Sometimes the Na'vi themselves die in these vision quests. The venom takes you to the edge of death.
249,Avatar,GRACE,No matter what you prove out there-- you are still in here. Right here.
250,Avatar,JAKE,I have to go all the way -- become one of THEM--
251,Avatar,GRACE,"Goddammit, Jake, you can never be one of them!"
252,Avatar,GRACE,Our life out there takes millions of dollars of machinery to sustain. You visit -- and you leave.
253,Avatar,GRACE,You can never truly be with her.
254,Avatar,JAKE,You know why I'm here? Because Quaritch sent me.
255,Avatar,JAKE,"That's right -- to embed with the Omaticaya. To find out how to screw them out of their home. By deceit or by force, he didn't care. And if it turned out to be force, then how best to do it."
256,Avatar,GRACE,"And what about now, Jake?"
257,Avatar,JAKE,I'm not that guy any more.
258,Avatar,GRACE,I know.
259,Avatar,JAKE,"But if I tell Quaritch the truth, he yanks me out -- I never see her again. And if I tell her the truth, the clan throws me out -- that's if they don't cut my heart out and show it to me."
260,Avatar,JAKE,"They don't even have a word for ""lie"" -- they had to learn it from us."
261,Avatar,GRACE,I know. I taught it to them.
262,Avatar,JAKE,Grace. I've gotta go. They're waiting.
263,Avatar,GRACE,Jake. You can't carry this burden much longer.
264,Avatar,JAKE,It's okay. Mo'at says an alien mind probably can't survive the Dream Hunt anyway.
265,Avatar,GRACE,Prep my link. I'm going in. CUT TO:
266,Avatar,JAKE,It's like -- a sound you feel.
267,Avatar,JAKE,I don't want Ninat.
268,Avatar,JAKE,I've already chosen. But this woman must also choose me.
269,Avatar,JAKE,"Neytiri, you know my real body is far away, sleeping."
270,Avatar,JAKE,We are?
271,Avatar,JAKE,"Really, we are?"
272,Avatar,JAKE,It's cool. I'm there.
273,Avatar,GRACE,Here -- eat this. I'd hate to have to force-feed a cripple.
274,Avatar,GRACE,She's not going anywhere.
275,Avatar,GRACE,"And when was the last time you took a shower? Jesus, Marine."
276,Avatar,JAKE,Hey! Heeeey! Stop! Stop!
277,Avatar,GRACE,Please -- this will only make it worse --
278,Avatar,JAKE,"Okay, listen. There's something I have to tell you. It's gonna be hard. I just need you to --"
279,Avatar,GRACE,Oh shit.
280,Avatar,GRACE,"Jake, don't --"
281,Avatar,JAKE,I accept. CUT TO:
282,Avatar,GRACE,What the hell are you doing?
283,Avatar,JAKE,It's the only way to get him to goddamn listen.
284,Avatar,JAKE,Are you out of your goddamn mind?!
285,Avatar,GRACE,"Parker, listen, there may still be time to --"
286,Avatar,GRACE,"Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot me? You need to muzzle your dog!"
287,Avatar,JAKE,You say you want to keep your people alive. Start by listening to her.
288,Avatar,GRACE,"This is bad, Parker. Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you can't imagine."
289,Avatar,GRACE,I'm not talking about pagan voodoo here -- I'm talking about something real and measurable in the biology of the forest.
290,Avatar,GRACE,I can't do this. How am I supposed to reduce years of work to a sound bite for the illiterate?
291,Avatar,JAKE,Just tell him what you know in your heart.
292,Avatar,GRACE,"Alright, look -- I don't have the answers yet, I'm just now starting to even frame the questions. What we think we know -- is that there's some kind of electrochemical communication between the roots of the trees. Like the synapses between neurons. Each tree has ten to the fourth connections to the trees around it, and there are ten to the twelfth trees on Pandora --"
293,Avatar,GRACE,That's more connections than the human brain. You get it? It's a network -- a global network. And the Na'vi can access it -- they can upload and download data -- memories -- at sites like the one you destroyed.
294,Avatar,GRACE,"You need to wake up, Parker. The wealth of this world isn't in the ground -- it's all around us. The Na'vi know that, and they're fighting to defend it. If you want to share this world with them, you need to understand them."
295,Avatar,JAKE,They're not going to give up their home -- they're not gonna make a deal. For what? Lite beer and shopping channel? There's nothing we have that they want. We're a horror to them. We're the monsters from space.
296,Avatar,JAKE,They're never going to leave Hometree.
297,Avatar,GRACE,"Parker, we have to talk, like rational people."
298,Avatar,GRACE,"They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose, to trigger a response. They're fabricating this war to get what they want."
299,Avatar,JAKE,"Yup. That's how it's done. When people are sitting on shit you want, you make them your enemy. Then you're justified in taking it."
300,Avatar,JAKE,When?
301,Avatar,GRACE,My God.
302,Avatar,GRACE,"Parker, wait. Stop! These are people you're about to --"
303,Avatar,GRACE,"For God's sake, there are children in there. Babies!"
304,Avatar,JAKE,"Look Selfridge, you don't want this kind of blood on your hands. Let me try to talk them out. They trust me."
305,Avatar,JAKE,"Eytukan, I have something to say, to everyone."
306,Avatar,JAKE,A great evil is upon us. The Sky People are coming to destroy Hometree. They will be here soon.
307,Avatar,JAKE,"You have to leave, or you will die."
308,Avatar,JAKE,"They sent me here to learn your ways. So one day I could bring this message, and you would believe it."
309,Avatar,JAKE,"Yes. At first it was just orders. Then everything changed. I fell in love-- with the forest, with the Omaticaya People -- -- with you. And by then, how could I tell you?"
310,Avatar,JAKE,"Neytiri. Please, I only wanted to --"
311,Avatar,JAKE,"You have to get out of Hometree! Run to the forest! Please, I'm begging you!"
312,Avatar,JAKE,We've gotta move! He's gonna blow the columns.
313,Avatar,JAKE,Neytiri! Neytiri!
314,Avatar,JAKE,I'm sorry --
315,Avatar,JAKE,"I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace. Sooner or later though, you always have to wake up..."
316,Avatar,GRACE,They never wanted us to succeed.
317,Avatar,JAKE,Thanks.
318,Avatar,JAKE,So what do you say? Time for a revolution?
319,Avatar,GRACE,I'm free.
320,Avatar,JAKE,Come on. CUT TO:
321,Avatar,JAKE,Get your ship fired up.
322,Avatar,JAKE,Stay here. I need somebody on the inside I can trust.
323,Avatar,JAKE,"Take it nice and easy, troop."
324,Avatar,JAKE,"On the ground, face down. Hands behind your head."
325,Avatar,GRACE,Do what he goddamn says!
326,Avatar,JAKE,Go! Go! Go!
327,Avatar,JAKE,"Oh yeah, baby!"
328,Avatar,GRACE,"Aaahh, crap. Not again."
329,Avatar,GRACE,This is gonna ruin my whole day.
330,Avatar,JAKE,"Hang on, Grace. CUT TO:"
331,Avatar,JAKE,"It's strongest at the Well of Souls, right?"
332,Avatar,JAKE,"Good, `cause that's where we're going."
333,Avatar,JAKE,"I'm gonna get you some help, Grace."
334,Avatar,GRACE,"Forget it, it doesn't matter."
335,Avatar,JAKE,No! The People can help you. I know it. CUT TO:
336,Avatar,JAKE,The Well of Souls. The heart of the forest. I knew the People would go there.
337,Avatar,JAKE,"I've gotta try, Norm."
338,Avatar,JAKE,"Outcast. Betrayer. Alien. To ever face them again, I was gonna have to change the rules."
339,Avatar,JAKE,Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move.
340,Avatar,JAKE,"Come on, boy. Time to fly."
341,Avatar,JAKE,"The way I had it figured, Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky. Nothing attacks him. So why would he ever look up?"
342,Avatar,JAKE,But that was just a theory.
343,Avatar,JAKE,I See you.
344,Avatar,JAKE,"Tsu'tey of the Rongloa, son of Ateyo. I stand before you, ready to serve the People. You are Olo'eyctan, and you are the best warrior. I can't do this without you."
345,Avatar,JAKE,Ireiyo.
346,Avatar,JAKE,Grace is dying. I beg the help of the Great Mother.
347,Avatar,JAKE,"Look where we are, Grace."
348,Avatar,GRACE,I need to take some samples.
349,Avatar,JAKE,Is that possible?
350,Avatar,JAKE,"Hang on, they're gonna fix you up."
351,Avatar,GRACE,"I -- always held back. But you gave them your heart. I'm proud of you, Jake."
352,Avatar,GRACE,Help them. You do whatever it takes. You hear me?
353,Avatar,JAKE,I will.
354,Avatar,GRACE,I'm with her Jake -- -- she's real --
355,Avatar,JAKE,Grace!
356,Avatar,JAKE,"With your permission, I will Speak now. You would honor me by translating."
357,Avatar,JAKE,"The Sky People have sent a message that they can take whatever they want, and no one can stop them. But we will send them a message. Ride out, as fast as the wind can carry you, tell the other clans to come. Tell them Toruk Macto calls to them. Fly now with me brothers and sisters! Fly! And we will show the Sky People that this is our land!"
358,Avatar,JAKE,"We rode out to the four winds. To the horse clans of the plain, to the ikran people of the mountains. When Toruk Macto called them, they came."
359,Avatar,JAKE,Talk fast.
360,Avatar,JAKE,Can you talk to Selfridge? Maybe we can cut some kinda deal before this thing goes all the way.
361,Avatar,JAKE,When?
362,Avatar,JAKE,Thanks.
363,Avatar,JAKE,That's right. Because I gave it to him on a plate.
364,Avatar,JAKE,Then I guess we better stop him.
365,Avatar,JAKE,Gonna have to settle for coffee. CUT TO:
366,Avatar,JAKE,I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace. But there was only one thing I was ever really good at. Ooh-rah.
367,Avatar,JAKE,Strike here and here.
368,Avatar,JAKE,Yeah.
369,Avatar,JAKE,What's your point?
370,Avatar,JAKE,I've never done this in my life.
371,Avatar,JAKE,And I'm probably just talking to a tree right now. But if you're there -- I need to give you a heads up.
372,Avatar,JAKE,"If Grace is there with you -- look in her memories -- she can show you the world we come from. There's no green there. They killed their Mother, and they're gonna do the same thing here."
373,Avatar,JAKE,More Sky People are gonna come. They're gonna come like a rain that never ends --
374,Avatar,JAKE,-- until they've covered the world. Unless we stop them.
375,Avatar,JAKE,It was worth a try.
376,Avatar,JAKE,"We have to stop the shuttles, no matter what it takes."
377,Avatar,JAKE,What the hell -- ?
378,Avatar,JAKE,WHOO-HOOOO!
379,Avatar,JAKE,"Quaritch is gonna take out the Well of Souls! He's got a clear shot. Hit him, anybody that can! Do it now!"
380,Avatar,JAKE,It's all over Quaritch --
381,Avatar,JAKE,Kinda hoped you'd say that.
382,Avatar,JAKE,"I See you, Tsu'tey te Rongloa Ateyitan."
383,Avatar,JAKE,They're safe.
384,Avatar,JAKE,No. I'm not officer material.
385,Avatar,JAKE,I'm not killing you.
386,Avatar,JAKE,No.
387,Avatar,JAKE,"Forgive me, my Brother. Go now to the Mother Spirit."
388,Avatar,JAKE,A few chose to stay. Fewer were chosen.
389,Avatar,JAKE,"The forest will heal, and so will the hearts of the People. New life keeps the energy flowing, like the breath of the world."
390,Avatar,JAKE,This is my last videolog.
391,Avatar,JAKE,"The science guys will keep the lights on, here. But I won't miss this place."
392,Avatar,JAKE,"I better wrap this up. There's a funeral tonight, and I don't want to be late. It was someone very close to me."
393,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,How bad is it?
394,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test phase.
395,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,What are the energy levels now?
396,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,How long to get everyone out?
397,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Do better.
398,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,We should tell them to go back to sleep?
399,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,I need you to make sure that PHASE 2 prototypes are shipped out.
400,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Until such time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every piece of PHASE 2 on a truck and gone."
401,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Talk to me, doctor. DR. ERIK SELVIG emerges from behind the CMS machine, concerned. The Tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings shoot out at random."
402,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Is there anything we know for certain?
403,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Is that supposed to be funny?
404,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,How soon until you pull the plug?
405,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"We've prepared for this, doctor. Harnessing energy from space."
406,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,That can be harmful. Where's Barton?
407,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Agent Barton, report. BARTON rappels down from the catwalk. Walks up to Fury. They both walk around the facility in a discreet manner."
408,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things.
409,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off?
410,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,At this end?
411,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Sir, please put down the spear! Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss Loki's fired shot. ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the platform and ATTACKS those firing at him. In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost gone to shit. Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand."
412,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"You have heart. Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands straight. As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract, placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then..."
413,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,Please don't. I still need that.
414,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"Of course it does. I've come too far for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose."
415,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,We have no quarrel with your people.
416,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,An ant has no quarrel with a boot.
417,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,You planning to step on us?
418,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"I come with glad tidings, of a world made free."
419,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Free from what?
420,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart... Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart. Selvig's eyes glow BLACK."
421,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,You will know peace.
422,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing. From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion."
423,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Like The Pharaohs of Odin.
424,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"Well, then... Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. Barton grabs the case containing the Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling."
425,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Hill, do you copy?! Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill."
426,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Barton is...
427,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,He's got the Tesseract! Track it down! The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the vacuum chamber ceiling.
428,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,The Tesseract is with the hostile force. I have men down. Hill?
429,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Sound the general call. I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that brief case.
430,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Coulson, get back to base. This is a LEVEL SEVEN. As of right now, we are at war. A beat."
431,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight? Did you feel an overabundance of control?"
432,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Not Asgard. Loki.
433,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help. It's up to us."
434,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We need a response team."
435,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,This isn't about The Avengers.
436,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need."
437,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"No, it's won by soldiers."
438,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,There's not enough time! I gotta put her in the water!
439,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Trouble sleeping?
440,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"I slept for seventy years, sir. I think I've had my fill."
441,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world. Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the tape off his hands. He sits down."
442,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"I went under, the world was at war, I wake up, they say we won. They didn't say what we lost."
443,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,We've made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently.
444,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"You here with a mission, sir?"
445,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,I am.
446,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Trying to get me back in the world?
447,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Trying to save it. Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files on HYDRA'S projects."
448,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Hydra's secret weapon.
449,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs."
450,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Who took it from you?
451,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,He's called Loki. He's not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.
452,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me."
453,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment. Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Starts walking out of the gym.
454,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?
455,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,You should have left it in the ocean.
456,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,You're good on this end. The rest is up to you.
457,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.
458,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"I assume. Light her up. As IRON MAN flies to the STARK TOWER BUILDING, the power is switched on and the STARK sign LIGHTS UP."
459,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Like Christmas, but with more... me."
460,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Pepper, you're killing me. Remember? Enjoy the moment."
461,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,I'm not in. I'm actually out.
462,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.
463,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which brings me to my next question: how does it feel to be a genius?"
464,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,What do you mean? All this came from you.
465,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself... twelve percent of the credit."
466,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,An argument can be made for fifteen.
467,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you."
468,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,My private elevator...
469,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I? Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne."
470,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,I'll tell you what. Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.
471,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"...Call your mom, can you bunk over?"
472,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message."
473,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Then leave it urgently. At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears.
474,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Security breach.
475,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent."
476,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Which is why he can't stay.
477,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,I don't like being handed things.
478,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.
479,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify."
480,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self- obsessed, don't play well with others."
481,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute? Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own databases."
482,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"You know, I thought we were having a moment."
483,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,How did you notice? Why is he Phil?
484,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"This is, uh... Tony EXPANDS his arms and different profiles appear in holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and Pepper."
485,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"This. Screens appear of CAPTAIN AMERICA IN ACTION, the HULK ROARING AS"
486,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Tomorrow.
487,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Well, what if I didn't?"
488,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Yeah.
489,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Square deal. It's the last date. Pepper kisses him.
490,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me?"
491,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Didn't really go his way, did it?"
492,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Well, I hope I'm the man for the job."
493,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,The uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little... old fashioned?
494,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,Let them go at themselves. I will lead them into glorious battle.
495,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is as formidable as you claim."
496,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard! Betrayed!
497,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"You don't have the Tesseract yet. THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his scepter."
498,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"I don't threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words."
499,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Ma'am?
500,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Trading cards?
501,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Dr. Banner. Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands.
502,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Word is you can find the cube.
503,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Only word I care about.
504,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Well, this is actually kind of familiar."
505,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Is this is a submarine?
506,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Good. Let's vanish.
507,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Gentlemen. Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it."
508,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Doctor, thank you for coming."
509,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear."
510,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,How many are there?
511,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please. Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall."
512,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton?"
513,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,Tell me what you need.
514,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"No, no. It's fine."
515,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Captain, you're up. Steve nods. Leaves."
516,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"Kneel before me. The crowd ignores him. Another LOKI appears, blocking the crowd. Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their spears, encircling the crowd."
517,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"I said. KNEEL!!! Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him. Loki embracing his arms out, smiling."
518,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel. As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an ELDER GERMAN MAN refuses to kneel and stands, heroic."
519,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,There are no men like me.
520,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example. Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light GLOWS blue. Just as the ENERGY BEAM shoots out, FUCKING CAPTAIN AMERICA arrives! He dives in just in time and BLOCKS the blast with his SHIELD, knocking down Loki on his ass."
521,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing."
522,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"I'm not the one who's out of time. From above Cap, the QUINJET arrives. A machine gun is pointed towards Loki."
523,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,Kneel.
524,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Not today! Cap FLIPS and KNOCKS him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and FLIPS him over.
525,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Agent Romanoff, did you miss me? Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky. Tony flies over in his IRON MAN suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. IRON MAN touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry the suit has."
526,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Make your move, Reindeer Games. Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armor materializes away."
527,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Good move.
528,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Mr. Stark.
529,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Captain.
530,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Said anything?
531,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Just get him here. We're low on time. With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch from a distance, whispering."
532,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,I don't like it.
533,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?
534,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,I don't remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop.
535,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates?"
536,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,What?
537,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a Capsicle. Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match."
538,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.
539,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you. THUNDER and LIGHTNING nearly hit the jet, making it shake violently."
540,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?
541,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,I'm not overly fond of what follows. What the fuck? OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet. Not a light. A King. THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the throat and flies out. Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck. Tony puts the IRON MAN helmet on.
542,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Now there's that guy.
543,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Think the guy's a friendly?
544,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost. Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after Thor."
545,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Stark, we need a plan of attack!"
546,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,I have a plan. Attack. IRON MAN jumps out of the jet and chases after Thor. Cap grabs a parachute to follow.
547,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,I don't see how I can.
548,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that. Cap JUMPS OUT of the jet."
549,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,Where is the Tesseract?
550,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!
551,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth. Thor drops MJÖLNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up Loki. His brother. Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is everything to a man or god."
552,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,I thought you dead.
553,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,Did you mourn?
554,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,We all did. Our father...
555,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not? Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even bigger wedge between them."
556,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that?"
557,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights. No, the Earth is under my protection, Loki."
558,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,You think yourself above them.
559,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"Well, yes."
560,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill. Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up to the ledge. Turns around."
561,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"I've seen worlds you've never known about! I have grown, Odinson, in my exile! I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it..."
562,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king?
563,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,I am a king!
564,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,Not here! You give up the Tesseract! You give up this poisonous dream! You come home.
565,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"I don't have it. You need the cube to bring me home, but I've sent it off I know not where. Mjölnir flies back to his grasp."
566,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"You listen well, brother. I..."
567,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,I'm listening.
568,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,Do not touch me again!
569,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Then don't take my stuff.
570,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,You have no idea what you're dealing with.
571,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes?
572,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice!"
573,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then, stay out of my way... tourist. The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjölnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear across into a tree."
574,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Okay. From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises his hand. Mjölnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the hammer, summoning a ray of energy. IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch! Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mjölnir to his hand, raises it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back."
575,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"How about that? IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up."
576,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Hey! That's enough! Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here."
577,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes!
578,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Then prove it! Put the hammer down.
579,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his hammer!"
580,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Are we done here?
581,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"In case it's unclear. You try to escape. You so much as scratch that glass. Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass. Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit his pants. Not a god, though."
582,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works?! Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki."
583,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Ant. Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel trap.
584,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Boot.
585,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Built for something a lot stronger than you.
586,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"Oh, I've heard. Loki looks into the camera."
587,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"The mindless beast, makes play he's still a man. How desperate are you, that you call upon such lost creatures to defend you?"
588,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,How desperate am I? You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can't hope to control.
589,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,You talk about peace and you kill `cause it's fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did.
590,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power. And for what? A warm light for all mankind to share, and then to be reminded what real power is."
591,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Loki's gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what's his play?"
592,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,Selvig?
593,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,He's a friend.
594,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,I wanna know why Loki let us take him. He's not leading an army from here.
595,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's my brother."
596,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,He's adopted.
597,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,It's a stabilizing agent. (walks in with Coulson; to
598,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick start the cube."
599,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes, the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading?"
600,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?
601,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect."
602,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Finally, someone who speaks English."
603,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Is that what just happened? Tony and Banner shake hands. A glimmer in their eyes shines as the mutual respect for each other shows.
604,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner. You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster."
605,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Let's start with that stick of his. It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon."
606,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube. And I'd like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys."
607,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,Monkeys? I do not understand.
608,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"I do! I understood that reference. Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself."
609,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Shall we play, doctor?"
610,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops."
611,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension. No surprises. Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD. Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony."
612,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Nothing?
613,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?"
614,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Is everything a joke to you?
615,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Funny things are.
616,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny. No offense, doctor."
617,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to strut."
618,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark."
619,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now? Why not before? What isn't he telling us? I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.
620,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,You think Fury's hiding something?
621,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets. It's bugging him too, isn't it?"
622,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Doctor? A beat.
623,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,I heard it.
624,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,The Stark Tower? That big ugly ...building in New York?
625,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,That's just the prototype. I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.
626,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.
627,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"I'm sorry, did you say...?"
628,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. Blueberry?
629,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around?
630,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not possible."
631,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"I think Loki's trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war, and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them."
632,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Following is not really my style.
633,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Of the people in this room, which one is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use?"
634,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Just find the cube. Steve walks out of the lab. Still torn apart by the possibility, he walks away, towards the HULL of the ship."
635,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,That's the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.
636,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit.
637,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does."
638,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.
639,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. This stops it. This little circle of light. It's part of me now, not just armor. It's a... terrible privilege."
640,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Because I learned how.
641,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gamma exposure should have killed you."
642,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,You just might.
643,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for him once he's done. Erik is a good man.
644,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced, but we...we come here battling like BILCHSTEIM."
645,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"BILCHSTEIM? You know; huge, scaly, big antlers. You don't have those?"
646,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"They are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path. Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the window, lamenting about what has happened and what may come."
647,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"When I first came to earth, Loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war."
648,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,War hasn't started yet.
649,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield, it's not just power he craves, it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain that would prize his need from him."
650,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops."
651,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,What are you asking me to do?
652,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,I'm asking. What are you prepared to do?
653,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,Loki is a prisoner.
654,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here? Thor doesn't answer.
655,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,There's not many people that can sneak up on me. (turns to see NATASHA
656,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"After. After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm. And I would cooperate."
657,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,I'd say I've expanded his mind.
658,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"Is this love, Agent Romanoff?"
659,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,And what will you do if I vow to spare him?
660,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,What is it you want?
661,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? DRAKOV'S daughter? SÃO PAULO? THE HOSPITAL FIRE? Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping, it's gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything?"
662,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,You lie and kill in the service of liars and killers. - Agent Hill checks every VIEWSCREEN in the bridge. Fury oversees.
663,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"You pretend to be separate, to have your own code, something that makes up for the horrors. But they are a part of you, and they will never go away! - Steve opens a STEEL crate. Angry, he looks behind him and looks back into the crate. THE CRATE IS FILLED WITH AN ARRAY OF"
664,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"I won't touch Barton. Not until I make him kill you! Slowly. Intimately. In every way he knows you fear! And when he'll wake just long enough to see his good work, and when he screams, I'll split his skull! This is my bargain, you mewling quim! NATASHA turns around, walks away from Loki, disgusted."
665,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Uh...kind of been wondering the same thing about you.
666,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.
667,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. What is PHASE 2? Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed."
668,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make weapons.
669,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we're..."
670,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"I'm sorry, Nick. Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of"
671,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,What were you lying?
672,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"I was wrong, director. The world hasn't changed a bit. At that moment, Thor and Natasha walk into the lab. Natasha keeps her eyes right on Banner. Banner looks at her, PISSED."
673,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Because of him.
674,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned."
675,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,My people want nothing but peace with your planet.
676,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"But you're not the only people out there, are you? And, you're not the only threat. The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, they can't be controlled."
677,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Like you controlled the cube?
678,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"You're work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for a higher form of war."
679,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,A higher form?
680,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,You forced our hand. We had to come up with something.
681,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always calms everything right down.
682,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark?"
683,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet and blow stuff up?"
684,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,Did you always give your champions such mistrust?
685,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"You speak of control, yet you court chaos."
686,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,You need to step away.
687,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?
688,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,You know damn well why! Back off!
689,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me."
690,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?"
691,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist."
692,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. Yeah, I've seen the footage."
693,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you."
694,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,I think I would just cut the wire.
695,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle!"
696,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds. Thor laughs at them."
697,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,You people are so petty... and tiny. Tony rubs his head. Moves away from Cap.
698,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr.Banner back to his..."
699,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,The cell was just in case...
700,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Doctor Banner... put down the scepter.
701,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Got it. Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer.
702,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,Located the Tesseract?
703,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,I can get there faster.
704,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Look, all of us..."
705,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no human is a match for it. Tony turns to leave, but Steve stops him."
706,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,You're not going alone!
707,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,You gonna stop me?
708,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Put on the suit, let's find out."
709,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,I'm not afraid to hit an old man.
710,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Put on the suit. At that moment Banner who's looking at the monitor notices something about the Tesseract.
711,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Put on the suit!
712,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Yep! Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab. Fury sits up, clutching his ribs. He puts on his EARPIECE."
713,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Hill?!
714,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Stark! You copy that?!
715,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,I'm on it!
716,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Coulson! Initiate official lock down in the detention section then get to the armory! Move out!
717,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Find engine three. I'll meet you there. Cap peels off as Tony approaches a tech room. Inside, Tony's IRON MAN suit stands waiting, lit above in all its glory."
718,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Bring the carrier inwards and head south. Take us to the water.
719,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Is the sun coming up?!
720,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Then put it on the left! Get us over water! One more turbine goes down and we drop.
721,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Stark, I'm here!"
722,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Good. See what we got. Tony flies in his IRON MAN suit and gets close to the damaged engine.
723,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris.
724,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"I need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position. IRON MAN flies into giant cooling conductors. CAPTAIN AMERICA JUMPS over to the other side of the broken railing. CAPTAIN AMERICA gets himself to the control panel and opens it up. For a man who grew up as a YANK, what the fuck is this!"
725,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,What's it look like in there?
726,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,It seems to run on some form of electricity.
727,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Well, you're not wrong."
728,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to think! HULK lifts his arm up, to Thor's surprise, and he SENDS HIM"
729,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,The relays are intact. What's our next move?
730,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump. I'm gonna have to get in there and push."
731,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Well if that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded!"
732,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag...
733,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Speak English!
734,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"See that red lever? It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by it, wait for my word. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks over at the other side where he was. He sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it."
735,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"We need a full evac on the lower hangar bay. Agent Hill nods. She leaves to exit out, but a SLIDING GRENADE appears."
736,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Get his attention.
737,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"They are not getting through here, so what the hell... Suddenly, Barton LOOSES an arrow down to the bridge and EXPLODES critical spots. Barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards Fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a USB"
738,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,It's Barton. He took out our systems. He's headed for the detention level. Does anybody copy?
739,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Stark, we're losing altitude."
740,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Yeah. Noticed. The rotors start propelling faster and faster as IRON MAN'S BOOSTERS get more and more bright. On the other side, CAPTAIN AMERICA continuously shoots at Barton's men. Blinking at the wrong moment, CAPTAIN AMERICA loses the upper hand and SLIDES off the railing, but grabs onto a LOOSE CABLE."
741,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,Are you ever not going to fall for that?
742,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,(smiles; walks over to the
743,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"Nooo! Loki sends Agent Coulson against the wall. Agent Coulson slumps down, breathing fast. Loki makes his way to the control switch. He gives his brother one last look. Thor looks at him, hopeful. Loki opens the HATCH. Thor still hopes. LOKI HITS THE BUTTON AND"
744,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"Your heroes are scattered, your floating fortress falls from the sky...where is my disadvantage?"
745,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,I don't think I...
746,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Cap, I need the lever!"
747,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,I need a minute here!
748,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Lever. Now! Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the rotors, getting chewed up."
749,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Just stay awake. EYES ON ME!
750,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Not an option.
751,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Agent Coulson is down. Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on her headset, standing up."
752,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,They're here.
753,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,They called it.
754,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"These were in Phil Coulson's jacket. Guess he never did get you to sign them. Fury throws Coulson's CAPTAIN AMERICA TRADING CARDS on the table towards Steve. Steve picks them up, STAINED WITH BLOOD."
755,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"We're dead in the air up here. Our communications, location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you. Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that coming."
756,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Well, it's an old fashioned notion."
757,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Was he married?
758,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"No. There was a uh...cellist, I think."
759,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.
760,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,He was an idiot.
761,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Why? For believing?
762,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,For taking on Loki alone.
763,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,He was doing his job.
764,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have...
765,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony."
766,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Is this the first time you've lost a soldier?
767,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching to Fury's fife!
768,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Neither am I! He's got the same blood on his hands as Loki does. Right now we've got to put that aside and get this done. Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list..."
769,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,(looking at the blood stained
770,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,That's not the point.
771,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,That is the point. That's Loki's point. He hit us all right where we live. Why?
772,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,To tear us apart.
773,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"He had to conquer his greed, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That's what he wants. He wants to beat us and he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience."
774,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Right, I caught his act at Stuttengard."
775,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Yeah. That's just a preview, this is opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built in the skies with his name plastered..."
776,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Time to go.
777,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly one of those jets? Barton walks out of the restroom. Looks at Cap.
778,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,You got a suit?
779,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Then suit up.
780,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Son... just don't.
781,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Agent Hill?
782,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,They needed the push. A LOUD NOISE SCREECHES. Fury looks out to see IRON MAN flying off as well as the QUINJET.
783,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"They found it. Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do. I want eyes on everything."
784,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Shut it down, Dr. Selvig."
785,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Okay. IRON MAN aims his hands toward the CMS and FIRES. The energy from his boosters SHATTERS with a deafening CRACK! Selvig falls backwards. DOWN BELOW, CITIZENS OF NEW YORK look up at STARK TOWER. IRON MAN stares in disbelief at the CMS ... unharmed."
786,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock. TONY lands his SUIT and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits him. LOKI looks up at him, smiling. They proceed to walk into the penthouse."
787,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.
788,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten you."
789,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,You should have left your armor on for that.
790,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage. You've got the blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink?"
791,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,Stalling me won't change anything.
792,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You sure? I'm having one."
793,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will change that. What have I to fear?"
794,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"Yes, I've met them."
795,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demi-God; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them."
796,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,That was the plan.
797,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they'll come for you. From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE BRACELETS, a honing device."
798,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,I have an army.
799,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,We have a HULK.
800,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,I thought the beast had wandered off.
801,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it."
802,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"How will your friends have time for me,when they're so busy fighting you? Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing. Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING."
803,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,It should work.
804,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Well, performance issues. You know? In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across the room."
805,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Jarvis. Anytime now. Loki grabs Tony by the throat again.
806,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"You will all fall before me. LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower. From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out. The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit. It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits the ground or the gazing people. Loki looks up, angry."
807,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"And there's one other person you pissed off! His name was Phil. Loki raises the scepter. IRON MAN FIRES at Loki, sending him on his ass."
808,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Right. Army. IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN flies towards the city."
809,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll destroy it!
810,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,You can't. There is no stopping it. There is only the war!
811,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"So be it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing another pent-up rage and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself."
812,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"What, did you stop for drive-thru? Swing up PARK, I'm gonna lay 'em out for you."
813,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Fine. Let's keep them occupied. IRON MAN heads back to the portal.
814,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Stark, are you seeing this?"
815,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"I'm seeing, still working on believing. Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?"
816,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Banner?
817,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a soft spot. IRON MAN quietly flies behind and parallel with the CHITAURI"
818,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,Look at this! Look around you! You think this madness will end with your rule?
819,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,It's too late. It's too late to stopit.
820,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"No. We can. Together. Loki looks at his brother, showing a sign of hope. Then... Loki stabs Thor with a small knife. Thor keels over."
821,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,"Sentiment. Thor gets up, KICKS Loki and lifts him into the air. Thor then SLAMS him down, hard. Loki, bleeding, rolls over the edge. Thor looks down. LOKI IS RIDING ON A FLYING CHARIOT. DOZENS of CHITAURI follow his lead."
822,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Those people need assistance down there. CHITAURI SOLDIERS that have landed near them and begin FIRING at them. BLACK WIDOW pulls both pistols and FIRES. Turns to Cap.
823,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,I need men in these buildings. There are people inside that can run into the line of fire. You take them through the basement or through the subway. You keep them off the streets. I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.
824,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,What's the story upstairs?
825,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,The powers surrounding the cube is impenetrable.
826,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Thor is right. We gotta deal with these guys.
827,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,As a team.
828,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,I have unfinished business with Loki.
829,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight focused on us and that's what we need. Without him these things could run wild. We got Stark up top, he's gonna need us... Just then, BANNER ARRIVES ON A SMALL MOTORBIKE. Getting off, he looks around the city."
830,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Stark? We got him.
831,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Banner?
832,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Just like you said.
833,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you. IRON MAN comes out from behind a building. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN follows, impatiently."
834,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Dr. Banner. Now might be a really good time for you to get angry.
835,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,Send the rest.
836,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Call it, Cap."
837,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Alright, listen up. Until we can close that portal up there, we're gonna use containment. Barton, I want you on that roof, eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays. Stark, you got the perimeter. Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or your turn it to ash."
838,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Right. Better clench up, LEGOLAS. IRON MAN lifts HAWKEYE up to the building."
839,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck that portal. Slow them down. You've got the lightning. Light the bastards up. You and me, we stay here on the ground, keep the fighting here. And Hulk.SMASH."
840,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Just try and keep them off the streets.
841,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"I will roger that. IRON MAN does so and leads towards TIGHT CORNERS and in HAWKEYE'S view, who fires arrow upon and arrow, EXPLODING the CHITAURI RIDERS. IRON MAN keeps leading CHITAURI RIDERS UNDER TUNNELS, THROUGH OPEN PARKING GARAGES. He looks back. None left."
842,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,Nice call. What else you got?
843,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,And he didn't invite me?
844,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.
845,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"You wanna get up there, you're gonna need a ride."
846,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Are you sure about this?
847,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,I'm on it.
848,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Everyone! Clear out! CAPTAIN AMERICA flips over the SOLDIER, grabs his SHIELD and just as the BOMB is about to GO OFF, CHITAURI BOMBER dives for, trying to stop it, but it GOES OFF, sending CAPTAIN AMERICA through the window, landing very hard on a car. The civilians look up from below. They're okay."
849,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid ass decision, I've elected to ignore it."
850,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman. Until I'm certain my team can't hold it, I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population."
851,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"I send that bird out, we already have. Fury shuts off his viewscreen."
852,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,JARVIS. You ever hear the tale of Jonah?
853,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Stark, you hearing me? We have a missile headed straight for the city."
854,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,How long?
855,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Three minutes, at best. Stay low and wipe out the missile."
856,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Jarvis, put everything we got into the thrusters!"
857,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,You ready for another bout?
858,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,What? You gettin' sleepy?
859,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Do it!
860,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"No, wait!"
861,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Stark, these things are still coming!"
862,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow in less than a minute. And I know just where to put it."
863,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Stark, you know that's a one-way trip?"
864,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,You might as well.
865,Avengers-The-(2012),CAPTAIN AMERICA,Close it.
866,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,"He's not slowing down. Thor swings Mjölnir around. Just as Thor flies up, THE HULK"
867,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,What the hell? What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me?
868,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,"Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job, guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day. Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it."
869,Avengers-The-(2012),THOR,We're not finished yet. A beat.
870,Avengers-The-(2012),IRON MAN,And then shawarma after.
871,Avengers-The-(2012),LOKI,If it's all the same to you. I'll have that drink.
872,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts. I'd say they've earned a leave of absence.
873,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,The Tesseract is where it belongs: out of our reach.
874,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,I didn't make it. I just didn't argue with the god that did.
875,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,"Oh, I think he will be."
876,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,They surely are. And the whole world knows it. Every world knows it.
877,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,A promise.
878,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,They'll come back.
879,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,I am.
880,Avengers-The-(2012),NICK FURY,Because we'll need them to.
881,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Little town, it's a quiet village Every day like the one before Little town full of little people Waking up to say..."
882,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,There goes the baker with his tray like always The same old bread and rolls to sell
883,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Every morning just the same Since the morning that we came To this poor provincial town
884,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Good morning, Monsieur Jean. Have you lost something again?"
885,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,To return this book to Pere Robert. It's about two lovers in fair Verona.
886,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,There must be more than this provincial life
887,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Two cities in Northern Italy. I didn't want to come back.
888,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Have you got any new places to go?
889,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Thank you, Pere Robert. Your library almost makes our small corner of the world feel big."
890,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Oh... isn't this amazing? It's my favorite part because you'll see Here's where she meets Prince Charming But she won't discover that it's him `Til chapter three
891,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,You've read it?
892,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Sorry, not tonight."
893,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,No.
894,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Papa, do you think I'm odd?"
895,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I don't know. People talk.
896,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Just tell me one more thing about her.
897,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,A rose like the one in the painting.
898,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"And every year, you bring it."
899,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I'll see you tomorrow!
900,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Stay safe...
901,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,The laundry.
902,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Come!
903,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,...over the dark wood.
904,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,All I wanted was to teach a child to read.
905,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I'm not ready to have children.
906,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"It's a small village, Gaston. I've met them all."
907,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Gaston, we could never make each other happy. No one can change that much."
908,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"I might be a farm girl, but I'm not simple. I'm sorry, but I will never marry you, Gaston."
909,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Can you imagine? Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless..."
910,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Madame Gaston, can't you just see it Madame Gaston, his little wife No sir, not me, I guarantee it"
911,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I want much more than this Provincial life...
912,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I want adventure in the great wide somewhere I want it more than I can tell And for once it might be grand To have someone understand I want so much more than They've got planned
913,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Must have lost his way in the woods...
914,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,A man of taste.
915,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Philippe?
916,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,What happened? Where is Papa?!
917,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Take me to him!
918,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Look, Cogsworth. A beautiful girl."
919,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,But what if she is the one? The one who will break the spell?
920,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Who said that? Who's there?
921,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Papa!? Is that you?
922,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Oh, your hands are ice. We need to get you home."
923,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Who?!
924,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Who's there? Who are you?
925,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I've come for my father.
926,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Liar!
927,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"I asked for the rose. Punish me, not him!"
928,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,A life sentence for a rose?
929,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Come into the light.
930,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Alright, Papa. I will leave. I need a minute alone with him."
931,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Are you so cold-hearted that you won't allow a daughter to kiss her father goodbye? Forever can spare a minute!
932,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I should have been with you.
933,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Forget you? Everything I am is because of you.
934,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"I love you too, Papa..."
935,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"I'm not afraid. And I will escape, I promise."
936,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,He is my father.
937,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Don't hurt him!
938,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle, but I have been sent to escort you to your room."
939,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,My room? But I thought --
940,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"What? That once this door closes it will not open again, RARRR? I know, he gets so dramatic."
941,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,`Allo.
942,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,AHHH!
943,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Oh, you are very strong. That's a great quality!"
944,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,What are you?
945,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,I am Lumière.
946,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,And you can talk.
947,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"What do you want to be for the rest of your life, Cogsworth: a man or a mantle clock?"
948,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Ready, miss? Trust me."
949,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"You must forgive first impressions, I hope you are not too startled."
950,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Why would I be startled? I'm talking to a candle.
951,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Candelabra, please. Enormous difference. But consider me at your service. The castle is your home now, so feel free to go anywhere you like --"
952,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Why, what's in the west wing?"
953,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Uh... nothing. Storage space. That's it.
954,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"This way, please!"
955,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Or as I like to call it, the only wing! Watch your step s'il vous plait."
956,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Welcome to your new home. It's modest, but comfortable..."
957,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,It's... beautiful.
958,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Of course. Master wanted you to have the finest room in the castle.
959,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Oh dear! We were not expecting guests.
960,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"I would risk anything to kiss you again, Plumette."
961,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,How can I be strong when you make me so weak?
962,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Is everything here alive? Hello, what's your name?"
963,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Do not be alarmed, mademoiselle. This is just your wardrobe. Meet Madame De Garderobe. A great singer."
964,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Ah, stay with us, Madame! We have someone for you to dress!"
965,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,But I'm not a princess.
966,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Mm. Subtle. Understated. I love it!
967,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Be calm, let me do the talking."
968,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,We thought you might appreciate the company.
969,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"That is true. But if the girl is the one who can break the spell, maybe you can start by using dinner to charm her. Good thinking, Cogsworth!"
970,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"You must try, master. With every passing day, we become less human."
971,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Yes. The poor thing is probably in there, scared to death."
972,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Just a minute.
973,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"You see, there she is. Now, master, remember. Be gentle."
974,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"And when she opens the door, give her a dashing debonair smile. Come come -- show me the smile."
975,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Oh mon dieu.
976,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,You've taken me prisoner and now you want to have dinner with me? Are you insane?
977,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,And I told you no!
978,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I'd starve before I ever ate with you!
979,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Oh master, you've returned!"
980,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Eh, I got you there!"
981,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Another petal fell...
982,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"I know, darling -- Ow! I'm getting more metallic every day."
983,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I told you to go away.
984,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I'm so worried about him. He's never been on his own.
985,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"But he said, ""If she doesn't eat with me, she doesn't eat at all."""
986,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"They're coming! Final checks, everyone, tout de suite!"
987,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Yes, I will make sure of it. But did you see her stand up to him? I am telling you, this girl is the one. They must fall in love if we are to be human again, and they can't fall in love if she stays in her room. Eh, Chapeau, you missed a spot!"
988,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"A broken clock is right two times a day, mon ami, and this is not one of those times."
989,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Stand up straight! It's time to sparkle!
990,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"I have no taste buds, but I can tell this is exquisite."
991,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Of course, of course. But what is dinner without a little... music?"
992,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Maestro Cadenza, are you ready?"
993,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Maestro, your wife is upstairs, finding it harder and harder to stay awake. She's counting on you to help us break this curse."
994,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Ma chere, mademoiselle. It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight. And now, we invite you to relax."
995,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Let us pull up a chair... as the dining room proudly presents...
996,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"... your dinner. Be our guest, be our guest"
997,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Put our service to the test Tie your napkin `round your neck, cherie And we provide the rest!"
998,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres Why we only live to serve Try the grey stuff, it's delicious"
999,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Don't believe me? Ask the dishes!
1000,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"They can sing, they can dance After all, miss, this is France!"
1001,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,And a dinner here is never second best Go on unfold your menu
1002,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Beef ragout, cheese souffle, Pie and pudding en flambé!"
1003,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,We'll prepare and serve with flair A culinary cabaret!
1004,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,You're alone and you're scared But the banquet's all prepared!
1005,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,No one's gloomy or complaining While the flatware's entertaining!
1006,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"We tell jokes, I do tricks With my fellow candlesticks"
1007,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Come on and lift your glass You've won your own free pass To be our guest If you're stressed, it's fine dining we suggest."
1008,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Oui our guest Be our guest, be our guest!"
1009,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Life is so unnerving For a servant who's not serving
1010,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,He's not whole Without a soul to wait upon
1011,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Ah, those good old days when we were useful Suddenly, those good old days are gone"
1012,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Too long we've been rusting Needing so much more than dusting Needing exercise A chance to use our skills
1013,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Most days we just lay around the castle Flabby, fat and lazy"
1014,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"You walked in, and oops-a-daisie!"
1015,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,She's our guest!
1016,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Pudding?!
1017,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Surely you're as trapped here as I am. Don't you ever want to escape?
1018,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Lumiere mentioned something about the West Wing...
1019,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Good night.
1020,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Nothing.
1021,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Checkmate. Again.
1022,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Mademoiselle... what are you doing?
1023,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Getting out of here!
1024,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Go go, Froufrou!"
1025,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Please, don't go! It's dangerous!"
1026,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,You have to help me... you have to stand...
1027,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"If you held still, it wouldn't hurt as much."
1028,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Well if you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away."
1029,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Well you should learn to control your temper.
1030,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Try to get some rest.
1031,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,We are eternally grateful.
1032,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Why do you care so much about him?
1033,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,But he has cursed you somehow. Why? You did nothing.
1034,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Let him sleep.
1035,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,How in the midst of all this sorrow Can so much hope and love endure? I was innocent and certain Now I'm wiser but unsure
1036,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,What happens when the last petal falls?
1037,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,The master remains a beast forever. And the rest of us become...
1038,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Knickknacks.
1039,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I want to help you. There must be some way to lift the curse.
1040,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Love can transpose to form and dignity. Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind. And therefore --
1041,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,So you know Shakespeare?
1042,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Actually, ""Romeo and Juliet"" is my favorite play."
1043,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Sorry?
1044,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Like what?
1045,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,It's wonderful.
1046,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Have you really read every one of these books?
1047,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Was that a joke? Are you making jokes now?
1048,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,The air is blue and keen and cold And in a frozen sheath enrolled
1049,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Each branch, each twig, each blade of grass Seems clad miraculously with glass"
1050,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"But in that solemn silence Is heard the whisper Of every sleeping thing: ""Look, look at me Come wake me up For still here I be."""
1051,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,There's something sweet and almost kind But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
1052,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,And now he's dear and so unsure I wonder why I didn't see it there before
1053,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,New and a bit alarming Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
1054,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,True that he's no Prince Charming But there's something in him that I simply didn't see!
1055,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Well, who indeed?"
1056,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,And who'd have guessed They'd come together on their own?
1057,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,What are you reading?
1058,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Guinevere and Lancelot.
1059,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,But still... it's a romance.
1060,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I never thanked you for saving my life.
1061,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,They know how to have a good time.
1062,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Me, too. The villagers say that I'm a ""funny girl,"" but I don't think they mean it as a compliment."
1063,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Almost as lonely as your castle.
1064,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,How amazing.
1065,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Paris.
1066,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,It's so much smaller than I imagined.
1067,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,This is the Paris of my childhood These were the borders of my life In this crumbling dusty attic Where an artist loved his wife I thought that I would find an answer Here where his heart has always lived
1068,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Now I see it's empty and abandoned Easy to remember Harder to move on Knowing that the Paris of my childhood Is gone
1069,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,That's the only story Papa could never bring himself to tell. And I knew better than to ask...
1070,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Let's go home.
1071,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"No, Master, it's perfect! The rose has only four petals left. Which means tonight... you must tell her how you feel."
1072,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Do not be discouraged.
1073,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,She is the one.
1074,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"You care for her, don't you? Well then, woo her with beautiful music and romantic candlelight..."
1075,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Don't worry, master, you'll do fine."
1076,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,In the dark.
1077,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Dark and very very dusty.
1078,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Start with the hair! Women love nice hair.
1079,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Dip dip, snip snip..."
1080,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,And the pièce de résistance...
1081,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"OK, I can fix this!"
1082,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I don't know...
1083,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Could anyone be happy if they're not free?
1084,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,My father taught me to dance. I used to step on his toes a lot.
1085,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Very much.
1086,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I'd like to see my father.
1087,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Papa! What are they doing to him?!
1088,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,What did you say?
1089,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Thank you.
1090,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Master... how could you do that?
1091,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Then why are we not human?
1092,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,STOP!
1093,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Open this door! He's hurt!
1094,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,My father's not crazy! Gaston... Tell him!
1095,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I have just come from the castle and there is a beast!
1096,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,You want proof? SHOW ME THE BEAST!
1097,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,There is your proof!
1098,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"No, don't be afraid. He is gentle and kind."
1099,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"He's not a monster, Gaston. You are. The beast would never hurt anyone."
1100,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"This isn't over Gaston, you'll see!"
1101,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,At least he has finally learned to love.
1102,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Could it be?
1103,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Sacrebleu! Invaders.
1104,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I have to warn the beast --
1105,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"He let me go, papa. He sent me back to you."
1106,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,He took me there. I know what happened to maman.
1107,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I understand.
1108,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Will you help me now?
1109,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Yes. Yes it is.
1110,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,I know what to do.
1111,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Watch your toes!
1112,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Bon voyage! Safe trip home!
1113,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Where is he?!
1114,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,NEVER.
1115,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,NO!
1116,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I tried to stop them!
1117,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Stop! Gaston, no!"
1118,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,No! It's too far!
1119,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,Of course I came back. I'll never leave you again.
1120,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,We're together now. It's going to be fine. You'll see.
1121,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"No... please, no..."
1122,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"We did it, Plumette. Victory is ours."
1123,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Plumette...? Oh! My dear Plumette...
1124,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"It's all right, Cogsworth."
1125,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,The honor was mine.
1126,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,"Please, don't leave me. Come back."
1127,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,I love you.
1128,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Cogsworth, we beat the clock!"
1129,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,Plumette... mon amour...
1130,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,"Oh, my Prince!"
1131,Beauty-and-the-Beast,LUMIÈRE,It's so good to see you!
1132,Beauty-and-the-Beast,BELLE,How would you feel about growing a beard?
1133,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"No need, Okoye. I can handle this alone . Okoye pauses, then returns her spear to the wall . T'Challa closes the model and steps to a marked circle in the floor."
1134,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,What are you talking about? I never freeze.
1135,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Nakia . . . I . . . I wanted to ...
1136,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"My father is dead , Nakia. The news devastates her ."
1137,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,This never gets old .
1138,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"Are you finished? Okoye slams her spear into the ground , signaling the rest of the Dora to follow her off . T'Challa turns to Shuri ."
1139,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,So surprised my little sister came to see me off before our big day .
1140,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"Update? No, it worked perfectly ."
1141,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,I cannot wait to see what kind of update you make to your ceremonial outfit. Shuri flips him off .
1142,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"How are you feeling today, mama?"
1143,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,I AM PRINCE T'CHALLA SO OF King
1144,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Yield! Don't make me kill you .
1145,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,What would the proud Jabari do without you? T'Challa tightens further.
1146,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"You have fought with honor , now yield! Your people need you . M'Baku looks up at the Jabari warriors ."
1147,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"Yield, man ! M' Baku grudgingly reaches out and TAPS. T'Cha l la lets him go and is barely ab l e to stand h i mself as Zuri steps forward . The crowd ERUPTS as struggling to catch his breath , T'Challa proud l y lifts his ar m."
1148,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Zuri .
1149,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Wakanda forever !! The arena ECHOES THE PHRASE emphatically .
1150,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Baba!
1151,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,I am sorry .
1152,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,That is not what I am talking about . I am not ready to be without you.
1153,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Never .
1154,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,He was there ! He was there . My father.
1155,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"Corne home , Nakia ."
1156,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Stay.
1157,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,What would you have Wakanda do about it? Nakia thinks for a bit .
1158,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"We are not like these other countries, Nakia. If the world found out what we truly are, and what we possess -- we could lose our way of life."
1159,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,If you were not so stubborn you would make such a great queen.
1160,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Ah! So you admit it !
1161,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"Is that him? Glory to Bast, man, is he still growing?"
1162,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Nakia thinks we should be doing more .
1163,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Foreign aid ... refugee programs. W'Kabi shakes his head.
1164,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"But waging war on other countries has never been our way . Then , both of their Kimoyo beads buzz."
1165,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"You too, huh?"
1166,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Klaue has escaped our pursuits for almost 30 years. Not capturing him was perhaps my father's greatest regret . I wish to bring Klaue back here to stand trial .
1167,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,I need you here protecting the border.
1168,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,You have my word I will bring him back.
1169,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"Stop it. Stop it. Shuri laughs and they do a special handshake before walking down the spiral walkway into her sprawling, futuristic lab."
1170,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Okoye. And Nakia as well. Shuri makes a face at Nakia .
1171,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Yes . We'll be fine .
1172,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,And what are these?
1173,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"What , you don't like my royal sandals? I wanted to go old school for my first day ."
1174,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Interesting .
1175,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Old ... ?
1176,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Enough .. .
1177,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Tempting . But the idea is to not be noticed . This one . Shuri uses her Kimoyo beads to sync the suit to T'Challa.
1178,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Anywhere?
1179,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"You told me to strike it, you didn't say how hard . Shuri picks the mannequin back up and drags it over to the same spot ."
1180,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"Well maybe you should make it a little stronger , eh? Shuri shrugs as we see Wakandan Script built into the suit GLOWING INDIGO where the impact of T'Challa's foot landed. T'Challa looks closely at the glowing script ."
1181,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Wait a minute .
1182,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Very nice.
1183,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,You are recording?
1184,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Delete that footage ...
1185,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Spread out. The buyer is likely already here. Okoye heads for the BALCONY VANTAGE POINT while T'Challa and Nakia go down to the FIRST FLOOR.
1186,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"The woman outside -- what trouble was she referring to? She plays along, alluring ."
1187,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"And will there be any trouble tonight, Ms. Kenyan heiress?"
1188,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Agent Ross .
1189,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,You are buying from Klaue ...
1190,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,I gave you Zemo.
1191,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"Klaue is leaving out that door with me. You've been warned. T'Challa walks toward another craps table , leaving the pile of chips behind ."
1192,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,I am not here to make a deal . Ross rolls his eyes .
1193,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,General .
1194,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,And the vibranium.
1195,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Stand down . We can't afford a shoot- out.
1196,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Shuri !
1197,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Keep go in g ! Panther uses his claws to make a sharp turn and avoid the wreck .
1198,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Don't worry about it . You're doing great . Panther leaps back onto the hood of the Lexus and they speed off . I/e . KLAUE'S 4RUNNER SPEAR STREET - NIGHT
1199,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Pull around the truck .
1200,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"Faster , Shuri ."
1201,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Did you think we would forget !? Klaue laughs .
1202,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Look at me murderer ! Where did you get this weapon?
1203,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Every breath you take is mercy from me.
1204,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"After your questioning , we will to take him back to Wakanda with us . Ross stares at T'Challa for a beat ."
1205,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,--Agent Ross .
1206,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,I do appreciate your help in Busan .
1207,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Okoye! Play nice.
1208,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"And you believe the word of an arms dealer , strapped to a chair. Ross hesitates , but doesn ' t bite ."
1209,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Give me a Kimoyo bead . T'Challa looks at Nakia and motions towards her Kimoyo bead. She pulls one off and hands it to him . T'Challa inserts it into Ross' wound.
1210,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,This will stabilize him for now .
1211,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Give him to us . We can save him.
1212,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"I am well aware of my duties, General. I cannot just let him die knowing we can save him."
1213,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,He's not here . T'Challa's eyes lower regretfully .
1214,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,He slipped through our hands .
1215,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"What happened to my Uncle N'Jobu? My father told me he disappeared ... there was a man today wearing a ring identical to this one . Zuri turns back and T'Challa lifts his hand, showing his VIBRANIUMRING from CA: CW . zuri turns away uncomfortable."
1216,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,He helped Klaue escape from us and he was wearing this ring . My grandfather ' s ring . Do not tell me what is possible tell me the truth .
1217,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,That is not your choice to make. What happened to him?
1218,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,I am your King now! Zuri looks up.
1219,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,No . .
1220,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,No no no no no no . . .
1221,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,And the child ...
1222,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,He killed his own brother ... and left a child behind with nothing . What kind of King . . what kind of man does that?
1223,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"He didn ' t even give him a proper burial ... My Uncle N'Jobu betrayed us , but my father may have created something even worse ."
1224,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Did he reveal anything about his identity?
1225,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"I don't care that you brought Klaue, the only reason I don't kill you where you stand is because I know who you are ... now what do you want?"
1226,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,And what tools are those?
1227,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Our our weapons will not be used to wage war on the world . It is not our way to be judge jury and executioner for people who are not our own .
1228,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"I am not King of all people. I am King of Wakanda. And it is my responsibility to make sure our people are safe and that vibranium does not fall into the hands of a person like you. The elders murmur at Killmonger's disrespect. They wait to see how T'Challa will respond . Then , Ramonda suddenly speaks ."
1229,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,No.
1230,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Take him away.
1231,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,I accept your challenge. W'Kabi looks at T'Challa closely .
1232,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"This is your last chance, thro w down your weapons and we can handle this another way."
1233,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"Yield ! Killrnonger FEROCIOUSLY BOBS INSIDE , but T'Challa lunges at Killrnonger, giving him a superficial SLASH ACROSS his cheek. Fueled by rage, Killmonger begins to overpower T'Challa . He slices T'Challa ' s thigh ."
1234,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"Zuri , no ."
1235,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"Nol Zuri no! Zuri!! Noo! Fueled by rage, T'Challa lifts back up to his feet. He charges Killmonger , who ducks his attacks, while talking to the audience ."
1236,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"Why, Baba?"
1237,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,You were wrong to abandon him .
1238,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"You were wrong ! All of you were wrong ! To turn your backs on the rest of the world . We let the fear of our discovery stop us from doing what is right . No more! I cannot stay here with you. I cannot rest while he sits on the throne . He is a monster of our own making . I must take the mantle back , I must. I must right these wrongs . T'Chaka looks at his son , his disappointment giving way to a proud smile ."
1239,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Do you have a blanket? They embrace. T'Challa turns to see Nakia and Shuri as well. The four of them embrace as M'Baku looks on .
1240,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Our resources . The Great Mound.
1241,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,He will send our weapons all over the world . T' Challa turns to Nakia .
1242,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,The challenge will have to continue .
1243,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,It is my duty to keep you safe .
1244,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Could you give me and Lord M' Baku a moment? Everyone exits and M'Baku gazes at T'Challa .
1245,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Thank you.
1246,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Please allow my mother to stay here .
1247,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,You know I could use an army as well.
1248,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,It is our cause . It is for all of us .
1249,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"I cannot speak for past Kings . But an enemy sits on the throne right now. We both know the power of vibraniurn . If Killmonger gets control of it, who do you think he will come for next? M'Baku sits ."
1250,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,N'Jadakalll !
1251,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"I never yielded, and as you can see, I am not dead ."
1252,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"W'Kabi stop this ! Stop this now ! W Kabi runs on top of a large ' rock to ga i n a vantage point , and pulls out a large HORN ."
1253,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Shuri I! The DOG PILE is LAU NCHED off through the air !
1254,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Shuri !
1255,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Turn on the train on the bottom track!
1256,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Neither will he.
1257,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,You want to see us become just like the people you hate so much? Divide and conquer the land as they did?
1258,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"You have become them . You will destroy the world, Wakanda included ."
1259,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Maybe we can still heal you . Killmonger thinks on this .
1260,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Thank you. You saved me. You saved my family . Our nation.
1261,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"You can't blame me I almost died . Nakia looks at him deeply, and kisses him back."
1262,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Stay . I think I know a way you can still fulfill your calling. Please stay. Nakia looks at T' Challa with curious eyes. She kisses him .
1263,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"This is where our father killed our uncle. Shuri looks at T'Challa, shocked by his bluntness. She turns and stares closely at the building. We see her POV of large SIGNAGE that hints that the building is soon to be demolished ."
1264,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,They're not tearing it down . . . I bought this building. Shuri turns to him confused .
1265,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"And that building , and that one over there ... This will be the first Wakandan International Outreach Center . Shuri smiles at the surprise."
1266,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,Nakia will oversee the social outreach ... And you will spearhead the science and information exchange . Shuri turns to T'Challa in shock at what this means.
1267,Black-Panther,T'CHALLA,"My name is King T'Challa , son of King T'Chaka . I am the sovereign ruler of the Nation of Wakanda and for the first time in our history we will be sharing our knowledge and resources with the outside world. Wakanda will no longer watch from the shadows . We cannot , we must not. We will work to be an example of how we as brothers and sisters on this Earth should treat each other . Now more than ever , illusions of division threaten our very e x istence. We all know the truth : more connects us than separates us . In times of crisis , the wise build bridges , while the foolish build barriers . We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe . The audience of WORLD LEADERS look around , bemused, wondering what Wakanda could possibly have to offer ."
1268,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Saturday...March 24, 1984. Shermer High School, Shermer, Illinois. 60062. Dear Mr. Vernon...we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was that we did wrong, what we did was wrong. But we think you're crazy to make us write this essay telling you who we think we are, what do you care? You see us as you want to see us...in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions. You see us as a brain, an athelete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal. Correct? That's the way we saw each other at seven o'clock this morning. We were brainwashed... CUT TO:"
1269,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,I can't believe you can't get me out of this...I mean it's so absurd I have to be here on a Saturday! It's not like I'm a defective or anything...
1270,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Last...
1271,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Mom, we're not supposed to study; we just have to sit there and do nothing."
1272,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Yeah, Mom already reemed me, alright?"
1273,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"Excuse me, sir? I think there's been a mistake. I know it's detention, but...um...I don't think I belong in here..."
1274,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Is this a test?
1275,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Crystal...

1282,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"I've seen you before, you know..."
1283,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Who do I think I am? Who are you? Who are you?
1284,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,I am a walrus...
1285,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"It's the shits, huh?"
1286,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,I can't believe this is really happening to me...
1287,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Oh, shit! What're we s'posed to do if we hafta take a piss?"

1307,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Uh, excuse me, fellas? I think we should just write our papers..."
1308,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Look, just because you live in here doesn't give you the right to be a pain in the ass...so knock it off!"
1309,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,It's a free country...
1310,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,He's just doing it to get a rise out of you! Just ignore him...
1311,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Sweets...you couldn't ignore me if you tried!
1312,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"So...so! Are you guys like boyfriend/girl- friend? Steady dates? Lo--vers? Come on Sporto, level with me. Do you slip her the hot...beef... injection?"
1313,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Go to hell!
1314,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Enough!
1315,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Scumbag!
1316,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,What do you say we close that door. We can't have any kind of party with Vernon checking us out every few seconds.
1317,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Well, you know the door's s'posed to stay open..."
1318,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,So what?
1319,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,So why don't you just shut up! There's four other people in here you know...
1320,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"God, you can count. See! I knew you had to be smart to be a...a wrestler."
1321,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Who the hell are you to judge anybody anyway?
1322,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Really...
1323,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"You know, Bender...you don't even count. I mean if you disappeared forever it wouldn't make any difference. You may as well not even exist at this school."
1324,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Well...I'll just run right out and join the wrestling team.
1325,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Maybe the prep club too! Student council...
1326,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"No, they wouldn't take you."
1327,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,I'm hurt.
1328,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,You know why guys like you knock everything...
1329,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Oh, this should be stunning..."
1330,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,It's 'cause you're afraid.
1331,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Oh, God! You ritchies are so smart, that's exactly why I'm not heavy in activities!"
1332,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,You're a big coward!
1333,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,I'm in the math club...
1334,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,See you're afraid that they won't take you. You don't belong so you just have to dump all over it...
1335,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Well...it wouldn't have anything to do with you activities people being assholes...now would it?
1336,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Well you wouldn't know...You don't even know any of us.
1337,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Well, I don't know any lepers either, but I'm not gonna run out and join one of their fucking clubs."
1338,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Hey let's watch the mouth, huh?"

1342,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Hey...Cherry...do you belong to the physics club?
1343,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,That's an academic club...
1344,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,So?
1345,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,So...academic clubs aren't the same as other kinds of clubs.
1346,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Oh, but to dorks like him..."
1347,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,...they are. What do you guys do in your club?
1348,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"In physics, um, we ah, we talk about physics...about properties of physics."
1349,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"So it's sorta social...demented and sad, but social. Right?"
1350,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Yeah, well, I guess you could consider it a social situation. I mean there are other children in my club and uh, at the end of the year we have, um, you know, a big banquet, at the, uh, at the Hilton."
1351,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"You load up, you party..."
1352,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Well, no, we get dressed up...I mean, but, we don't...we don't get high."
1353,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Only burners like you get high...
1354,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"And, uh, I didn't have any shoes. So I had to borrow my dad's. It was kinda weird 'cause my mom doesn't like me to wear other people's shoes. And, uh, my cousin Kent...my cousin Kendall from, uh, Indiana... He got high once and you know, he started eating like really weird foods. And uh, and then he just felt like he didn't belong anywhere. You know, kinda like, you know ""Twilight Zone"" kinda."
1355,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Sounds like you...
1356,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Look, you guys keep up your talking and Vernon's gonna come right in here...I got a meet this Saturday and I'm not gonna miss it on account of you boneheads..."
1357,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Oh and wouldn't that be a bite...
1358,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Missing a whole wrestling meet!
1359,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Well you wouldn't know anything about it, faggot! You never competed in your whole life!"
1360,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Oh, I know...I feel all empty inside because of it. I have such a deep admiration for guys that roll around on the floor with other guys!"
1361,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Ahhh...you'd never miss it. You don't have any goals.
1362,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Oh, but I do!"
1363,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Yeah?
1364,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,I wanna be just--like--you! I figure all I need's a labotamy and some tights!
1365,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,You wear tights?
1366,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"No I don't wear tights, I wear the required uniform..."
1367,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Tights...
1368,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Shut up!
1369,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,You know there's not s'posed to be any monkey business!
1370,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Young man...have you finished your paper?
1371,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,What are you gonna do?
1372,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Drop dead, I hope! CUT TO:"
1373,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Bender, that's, that's school property there...you know, it doesn't belong to us. It's something not to be toyed with."
1374,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"That's very funny, come on, fix it!"
1375,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,You should really fix that!
1376,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Am I a genius?
1377,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"No, you're an asshole!"
1378,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,What a funny guy!
1379,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Fix the door Bender!
1380,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Everyone just shhh! CUT TO:
1381,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"I've been here before, I know what I'm doing!"
1382,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"No! Fix the door, get up there and fix it!"
1383,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Shut up! CUT TO:
1384,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"How're we s'posed to know? We're not s'posed to move, right?"
1385,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"We were just sitting here, like we were s'posed to..."
1386,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,I think a screw fell out of it...
1387,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"It just closed, sir..."
1388,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"She doesn't talk, sir..."
1389,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,I don't have it...
1390,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"I don't have it...screws fall out all of the time, the world's an imperfect place..."
1391,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"Excuse me, sir, why would anybody want to steal a screw?"
1392,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"The door's way too heavy, sir."
1393,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up? If he gets up, we'll all get up, it'll be anarchy!"
1394,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,It's out of my hands...
1395,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"That's very clever sir, but what if there's a fire? I think violating fire codes and endangering the lives of children would be unwise at this juncture in your career, sir."
1396,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,You know the school comes equipped with fire exits at either end of the library.
1397,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Show Dick some respect!
1398,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Eat my shorts...
1399,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Eat my shorts!
1400,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Oh, Christ..."
1401,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Well, I'm free the Saturday after that...beyond that, I'm gonna have to check my calendar!"
1402,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,No!
1403,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,So?
1404,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Yes!
1405,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Cut it out!
1406,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Not even close, bud!"
1407,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Do you really think I give a shit?
1408,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,How many is that?
1409,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,That's seven including the one when we first came in and you asked Mr. Vernon here whether Barry Manilow knew that he raided his closet.
1410,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Excuse me, sir, it's seven!"
1411,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,What can I say? I'm thrilled!
1412,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Fuck you!
1413,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,That's real intelligent.
1414,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,You're right...it's wrong to destroy literature...
1415,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"It's such fun to read...and, Molet really pumps my nads!"
1416,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Mol-yare.
1417,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,I love his work.
1418,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Big deal...nothing to do when you're locked in a vacancy..
1419,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Speak for yourself...
1420,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Do you think I'd speak for you? I don't even know your language!
1421,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Hey, you grounded tonight?"
1422,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"I don't know, my mom said I was but by dad told me to just blow her off."
1423,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Big party at Stubbies, parents are in Europe. Should be pretty wild..."
1424,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Yeah?
1425,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Yeah, can you go?"
1426,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,I doubt it...
1427,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,How come?
1428,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"Well 'cause if I do what my mother tells me not to do, it's because because my father says it's okay. There's like this whole big monster deal, it's endless and it's a total drag. It's like any minute... divorce..."
1429,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Who do you like better?
1430,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,What?
1431,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,You like your old man better than your mom?
1432,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,They're both strict.
1433,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"No, I mean, if you had to choose between them."
1434,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"I dunno, I'd probably go live with my brother. I mean, I don't think either one of them gives a shit about me...it's like they use me just to get back at each other."
1435,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Shut up!
1436,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,You're just feeling sorry for yourself...
1437,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"Yeah, well if I didn't nobody else would."
1438,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Aw...you're breaking my heart...
1439,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Sporto...
1440,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,What?
1441,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,You get along with your parents?
1442,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Well if I say yes, I'm an idiot, right?"
1443,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,You're an idiot anyway...But if you say you get along with your parents well you're a liar too!
1444,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"You know something, man...If we weren't in school right now, I'd waste you!"
1445,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Can you hear this? Want me to turn it up?
1446,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Hey fellas, I mean..."
1447,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"...I don't like my parents either, I don't...I don't get along with them...their idea of parental compassion is just, you know, wacko!"
1448,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Dork...
1449,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Yeah?
1450,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"You are a parent's wet dream, okay?"
1451,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Well that's a problem!
1452,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Look, I can see you getting all bunged up for them making you wear these kinda clothes. But face it, you're a Neo-Maxi-Zoom-Dweebie! What would you be doing if you weren't out making yourself a better citizen?"
1453,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Why do you have to insult everybody?
1454,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"I'm being honest, asshole! I would expect you...to know the difference!"
1455,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Yeah well, he's gotta name!"
1456,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Yeah?
1457,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Yeah, What's your name?"
1458,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Brian...
1459,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,See...
1460,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,My condolences...
1461,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,What's your name?
1462,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,What's yours?
1463,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Claire...
1464,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Ka-Laire?
1465,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Claire...it's a family name!
1466,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Nooo...It's a fat girl's name!
1467,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Well thank you...
1468,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,You're welcome...
1469,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,I'm not fat!
1470,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Well not at present but I could see you really pushing maximum density! You see, I'm not sure if you know this...but there are two kinds of fat people. There's fat people that were born to be fat, and then there's fat people that were once thin but they became fat...so when you look at them you can sorta see that thin person inside! You see, you're gonna get married, you're gonna squeeze out a few puppies and then, uh..."
1471,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Oh...obscene finger gestures from such a pristine girl!
1472,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,I'm not that pristine!
1473,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Are you a virgin? I'll bet you a million dollars that you are! Let's end the suspense! Is it gonna be... ...a white weddin?
1474,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Why don't you just shut up?
1475,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Have you ever kissed a boy on the mouth? Have you ever been felt up? Over the bra, under the blouse, shoes off...hoping to God your parents don't walk in?"
1476,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Do you want me to puke?
1477,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Over the panties, no bra, blouse unbuttoned, Calvin's in a ball on the front seat past eleven on a school night?"
1478,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Leave her alone!
1479,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,I said leave her alone!
1480,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,You gonna make me?

1484,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,I don't wanna get into to this with you man...
1485,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Why not?
1486,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,'Cause I'd kill you...It's real simple. I'd kill you and your fucking parents would sue me and it would be a big mess and I don't care enough about you to bother.
1487,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Chicken shit...
1488,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Let's end this right now. You don't talk to her...you don't look at her and you don't even think about her! You understand me?
1489,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,I'm trying to help her!.
1490,Breakfast-Club-The,CARL,"Brian, how you doing?"
1491,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Your dad works here?
1492,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Uh, Carl?"
1493,Breakfast-Club-The,CARL,What?
1494,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Can I ask you a question?
1495,Breakfast-Club-The,CARL,Sure...
1496,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,How does one become a janitor?
1497,Breakfast-Club-The,CARL,You wanna be a janitor?
1498,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"No I just wanna know how one becomes a janitor because Andrew here, is very interested in persuing a career in the custodial arts..."
1499,Breakfast-Club-The,CARL,"Oh, really? You guys think I'm just some untouchable peasant? Peon? Huh? Maybe so, but following a broom around after shitheads like you for the past eight years I've learned a couple of things...I look through your letters, I look through your lockers...I listen to your conversations, you don't know that but I do...I am the eyes and ears of this institution my friends. By the way, that clock's twenty minutes fast!"
1500,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Shit! CUT TO:
1501,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Here?
1502,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Well I think the cafeteria would be a more suitable place for us to eat lunch in, sir!"
1503,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Uh, Dick? Excuse me, Rich...will milk be made available to us?"
1504,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,We're extremely thirsty sir...
1505,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,I have a very low tolerance for dehydration.
1506,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"I've seen her dehydrate sir, it's pretty gross."
1507,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Relax, I'll get it!"
1508,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"So, what's your poison?"
1509,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,What do you drink?
1510,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Okay...forget I asked...
1511,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Vodka? When do you drink vodka?
1512,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,A lot?
1513,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Is that why you're here today?
1514,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Why are you here?
1515,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Um, I'm here today...because uh, because my coach and my father don't want me to blow my ride. See I get treated differently because uh, Coach thinks I'm a winner. So does my old man. I'm not a winner because I wanna be one... I'm a winner because I got strength and speed. Kinda like a race horse. That's about how involved I am in what's happening to me."
1516,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Forget it! CUT TO:
1517,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Claire...you wanna see a picture of a guy with elephantitus of the nuts? It's pretty tasty...
1518,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,No thank you...
1519,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,How do you think he rides a bike?
1520,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Oh, Claire...would you ever consider dating a guy like this?"
1521,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Can't you just leave me alone?
1522,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,I mean if he had a great personality and was a good dancer and had a cool car...Although you'd probably have to ride in the back seat 'cause his nuts would ride shotgun.
1523,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,You know what I wish I was doing?
1524,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Op, watch what you say, Brian here is a cherry."
1525,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,A cherry?
1526,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,I wish I was on a plane to France.
1527,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,I'm not a cherry.
1528,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,When have you ever gotten laid?
1529,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"I've laid, lotsa times!"
1530,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Name one!
1531,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"She lives in Canada, met her at Niagra Falls. You wouldn't know her."
1532,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Ever laid anyone around here.
1533,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Oh, you and Claire, did it!"
1534,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,What are you talking about?
1535,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Nothin', nothin! Let's just drop it, we'll talk about it later!"
1536,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"No! Drop what, what're you talking about?"
1537,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Well, Brian's trying to tell me that in addition to the number of girls in the Niagra Falls area, that presently you and he are, riding the hobby horse!"
1538,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Little pig!
1539,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"No I'm not! I'm not! John said I was a cherry and I said I wasn't, that's it, that's all that was said!"
1540,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Well then what were you motioning to Claire for?
1541,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"You know I don't appreciate this very much, Brian."
1542,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,He is lying!
1543,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Oh you weren't motioning to Claire?
1544,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"You know he's lying, right?"
1545,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Were you or were you not motioning to Claire?
1546,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Yeah, but it was only...was only because I didn't want her to know that I was a virgin, okay?"
1547,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Excuse me for being a virgin, I'm sorry..."
1548,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Why didn't you want me to know you were a virgin?
1549,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Because it's personal business, it's my personal, private business."
1550,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Well Brian, it doesn't sound like you're doing any business..."
1551,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,I think it's okay for a guy to be a virgin...
1552,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,You do?
1553,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,What's in there?
1554,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"Guess, where's your lunch?"

1561,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,You won't accept a guys tongue in your mouth and you're gonna eat that?
1562,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Can I eat?
1563,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,I don't know...give it a try...
1564,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,What's your problem?
1565,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,What're we having?
1566,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Uh, it's your standard, regular lunch I guess..."
1567,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Milk?
1568,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Soup.
1569,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,That's apple juice...
1570,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"I can read! PB & J with the crusts cut off...Well Brian, this is a very nutritous lunch, all the food groups are represented. Did your mom marry Mr. Rogers?"
1571,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Uh, no, Mr. Johnson..."
1572,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Ahhh....
1573,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Here's my impression of life at big Bri's house... Son! Yeah Dad? How's your day, pal? Great Dad, how's yours?

1579,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Is that for real?
1580,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,You wanna come over sometime?
1581,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"That's bullshit. It's all part of your image, I don't believe a word of it."
1582,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,You don't believe me?
1583,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,No...
1584,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,No?
1585,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Did I stutter?
1586,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Do you believe this? Huh? It's about the size of a cigar...Do I stutter? You see, this is what you get in my house when you spill paint in the garage."
1587,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,See I don't think that I need to sit here with you fuckin' dildos anymore!

1593,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"I don't...being bad feels pretty good, huh?"
1594,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,What's the point in going to Bender's locker?
1595,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Beats me...
1596,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"This is so stupid...Why do you think, why are we risking getting caught?"
1597,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,I dunno...

1693,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Are you gonna be like a shopping bag lady? You know like, sit in alleyways and like talk to buildings and wear men's shoes and that kinda thing?"
1694,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Why do you have to do anything?
1695,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,So you're saying you'd subject yourself to the violent dangers of the Chicago streets because your homelife is unsatisfying?
1696,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Andy...you wanna get in on this? Allison here says, she wants to run away, because her home life is unsatisfying..."
1697,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Well everyone's home lives are un- satisfying...If it wasn't, people would live with there parents forever..."

1710,Breakfast-Club-The,CARL,"Aw bull shit, man. Come on Vern, the kids haven't changed, you have! You took a teaching position, 'cause you thought it'd be fun, right? Thought you could have summer vacations off...and then you found out it was actually work...and that really bummed you out."

1717,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Well, how'm I s'posed to answer?"
1718,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"The idea is to like search your mind for the absolute limit. Like, uh, would you drive to school naked?"
1719,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Um, uh...would I have to get out of the car?"
1720,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Of course...
1721,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"In the spring, or winter?"
1722,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,It doesn't matter...spring...

1724,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Either one...
1725,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Yes...
1726,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,You're lying...
1727,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Lie...

1729,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,And what'd he do when you told him?
1730,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Very nice...
1731,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,He's an adult!
1732,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Do you have any idea how completely gross that is?
1733,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,First few times? You mean he did it more than once?
1734,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Are you crazy?
1735,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Obviously she's crazy if she's screwing her shrink...
1736,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,I don't even have a psychiatrist...
1737,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"Now, didn't we already cover this?"
1738,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,You never answered the question...
1739,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"Look, I'm not gonna discuss my private life with total strangers."
1740,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,A what?
1741,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Wrong...
1742,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,She's a tease...
1743,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Oh why don't you just forget it...
1744,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"You're a tease and you know it, all girls are teases!"
1745,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,She's only a tease if what she does gets you hot...
1746,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,I don't do anything!
1747,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"Okay, lemme ask you a few questions."
1748,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,No! Doesn't it bother you to sleep around without being in love. I mean don't you want any respect?
1749,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"Not the only difference, I hope."
1750,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Face it, you're a tease."
1751,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,I'm not a tease!
1752,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Sure you are! You said it yourself sex is a weapon, you use it to get respect!"
1753,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"No, I never said that, she twisted my words around."
1754,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Oh then what do you use it for?
1755,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,I don't use it period!
1756,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Oh, are you medically frigid or is it psychological?"
1757,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,I didn't mean it that way! You guys are putting words into my mouth!
1758,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Well if you'd just answer the question...
1759,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Why don't you just answer the question?
1760,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Be honest...
1761,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,No big deal...
1762,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Yeah, answer it!"
1763,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Answer the question, Claire!"
1764,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Talk to us!
1765,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"It's easy, it's only one question!"
1766,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,No! I never did it!
1767,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,You are such a bitch! You did that on purpose just to fuck me over!
1768,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"I can't believe you, you're so weird. You don't say anything all day and then when you open your mouth...you unload all these tremendous lies all over me!"
1769,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,You're just pissed off because she got you to admit something you didn't want to admit to...
1770,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it any less bizarre..."
1771,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"What's bizarre? I mean we're all pretty bizarre! Some of us are just better at hiding it, that's all."
1772,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,How are you bizarre?
1773,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"She's right...do you guys know what, uh, what I did to get in here? I taped Larry Lester's buns together."
1774,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,That was you?
1775,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Yeah, you know him?"
1776,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Yeah, I know him..."
1777,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Well then you know how hairy he is, right? Well, when they pulled the tape off, most of his hair came off and some, some skin too..."
1778,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Oh my God...
1779,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"And the bizarre thing is, is that I did it for my old man...I tortured this poor kid, because I wanted him to think that I was cool. He's always going off about, you know, when he was in school...all the wild things he used to do. And I got the feeling that he was disappointed that I never cut loose on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm sitting in the locker room, and I'm taping up my knee. And Larry's undressing a couple lockers down from me. Yeah...he's kinda... he's kinda skinny, weak. And I started thinking about my father, and his attitude about weakness. And the next thing I knew, I uh, I jumped on top of him and started wailing on him...And my friends, they just laughed and cheered me on. And afterwards, when I was sittin' in Vernon's office, all I could think about was Larry's father. And Larry havin' to go home and...and explain what happened to him. And the humiliation...fucking humiliation he mustuv felt. It mustuv been unreal...I mean, I mean, how do you apologize for something like that? There's no way...it's all because of me and my old man. Oh God, I fucking hate him! He's like this...he's like this mindless machine that I can't even relate to anymore...""Andrew, you've got to be number one! I won't tolerate any losers in this family...Your intensity is for shit! Win. Win! WIN!!!"" You son of a bitch! You know, sometimes, I wish my knee would give...and I wouldn't be able to wrestle anymore. And he could forget all about me..."
1780,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,I think your old man and my old man should get together and go bowling.
1781,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"It's like me, you know, with my grades...like, when I, when I step outside myself kinda, and when I, when I look in at myself you know? And I see me and I don't like what I see, I really don't."
1782,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,What's wrong with you? Why don't you like yourself?
1783,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing shop. See we had this assignment, to make this ceramic elephant, and um...and we had eight weeks to do it and we're s'posed ta, and it was like a lamp, and when you pull the trunk the light was s'posed to go on...my light didn't go on, I got a F on it. Never got a F in my life... When I signed up, you know, for the course I mean. I thought I was playing it real smart, you know. 'Cause I thought, I'll take shop, it'll be such an easy way to maintain my grade point average..."
1784,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Why'd you think it'd be easy?
1785,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Have you seen some of the dopes that take shop?
1786,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,I take shop...you must be a fuckin' idiot!
1787,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't make a lamp?
1788,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"No, you're a genius because you can't make a lamp..."
1789,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,What do you know about Trigonometry?
1790,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,I could care less about Trigonometry...
1791,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Bender, did you know without Trigonometry there'd be no engineering?"
1792,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Without lamps, there'd be no light!"
1793,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Okay so neither one of you is any better than the other one...
1794,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,With your feet?
1795,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,I can make spaghetti!
1796,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,What can you do?
1797,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,I can...uh...tape all your buns together...
1798,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,I wanna see what Claire can do!
1799,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,I can't do anything.
1800,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Now, everybody can do something..."
1801,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"There's one thing I can do, no forget it, it's way too embarrassing."
1802,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,You ever seen Wild Kingdom? I mean that guy's been doing that show for thirty years.
1803,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"Okay, but you have to swear to God you won't laugh...I can't believe I'm actually doing this..."
1804,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"All right, great! Where'd you learn to do that?"
1805,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"Camp, seventh grade..."
1806,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"That was great, Claire...my image of you is totally blown..."
1807,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Am I laughing?
1808,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,You fucking prick!
1809,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"What do you care what I think, anyway? I don't even count, right? I could disappear forever and it wouldn't make any difference...I may as well not even exist at this school, remember? And you...don't like me anyway!"
1810,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"You know, I have just as many feelings as you do and it hurts just as much when somebody steps all over them!"
1811,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"God, you're so pathetic! Don't you ever...ever! Compare yourself to me! Okay? You got everything, and I got shit! Fuckin' Rapunzel, right? School would probably fucking shut down if you didn't show up! ""Queenie isn't here!"" I like those earrings Claire."
1812,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Shut up...
1813,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Are those real diamonds, Claire?"
1814,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Shut up!
1815,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Or did your daddy buy those?
1816,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Shut up!
1817,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"I bet he bought those for you! I bet those are a Christmas gift! Right? You know what I got for Christmas this year? It was a banner fuckin' year at the old Bender family! I got a carton of cigarettes. The old man grabbed me and said ""Hey! Smoke up Johnny!"" Okay, so go home'n cry to your daddy, don't cry here, okay?"
1818,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"My God, are we gonna be like our parents?"
1819,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Not me...ever...
1820,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,What happens?
1821,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Who cares?
1822,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Um, I was just thinking, I mean. I know it's kind of a weird time, but I was just wondering, um, what is gonna happen to us on Monday? When we're all together again? I mean I consider you guys my friends, I'm not wrong, am I?"
1823,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,No...
1824,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"So, so on Monday...what happens?"
1825,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"Are we still friends, you mean? If we're friends now, that is?"
1826,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Yeah...
1827,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Do you want the truth?
1828,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Yeah, I want the truth..."
1829,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,I don't think so...
1830,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,With all of you...
1831,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"That's a real nice attitude, Claire!"
1832,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came walking up to you in the hall on Monday, what would you do? I mean picture this, you're there with all the sports. I know exactly what you'd do, you'd say hi to him and when he left you'd cut him all up so your friends wouldn't think you really liked him!"
1833,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,No way!
1834,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Same exact thing!
1835,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,You are a bitch!
1836,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"Why? 'Cause I'm telling the truth, that makes me a bitch?"
1837,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,No! 'Cause you know how shitty that is to do to someone! And you don't got the balls to stand up to your friends and tell 'em that you're gonna like who you wanna like!
1838,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"Okay, what about you, you hypocrite! Why don't you take Allison to one of your heavy metal vomit parties? Or take Brian out to the parking lot at lunch to get high? What about Andy for that matter, what about me? What would your friends say if we were walking down the hall together. They'd laugh their asses off and you'd probably tell them you were doing it with me so they'd forgive you for being seen with me."
1839,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"Don't you ever talk about my friends! You don't know any of my friends, you don't look at any of my friends and you certainly wouldn't condescend to speak to any of my friends so you just stick to the things you know, shopping, nail polish, your father's BMW and your poor--rich--drunk mother in the Carribean!"
1840,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Shut up!
1841,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"And as far as being concerned about what's gonna happen when you and I walk down the hallways at school, you can forget it! 'Cause it's never gonna happen! Just bury your head in the sand...and wait for your fuckin' prom!"
1842,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,I hate you!
1843,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Yeah? Good!
1844,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Then I assume Allison and I are better people than you guys, huh? Us weirdos... Do you, would you do that to me?"
1845,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Well if you did?
1846,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"I just wanna tell, each of you, that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't and I will not! 'Cause I think that's real shitty..."
1847,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Your friends wouldn't mind because they look up to us...
1848,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"You're so conceited, Claire. You're so conceited. You're so, like, full of yourself, why are you like that?"
1849,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,I'm not saying that to be conceited! I hate it! I hate having to go along with everything my friends say!
1850,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Well then why do you do it?
1851,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"I don't know, I don't...you don't understand..you don't. You're not friends with the same kind of people that Andy and I are friends with! You know, you just don't understand the pressure that they can put on you!"
1852,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"I don't understand what? You think I don't understand pressure, Claire? Well fuck you! Fuck you!"
1853,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Know why I'm here today? Do you? I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a gun in the locker...
1854,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Why'd you have a gun in your locker?
1855,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"I tried. You pull the fuckin' trunk on it and the light's s'posed to go on...and it didn't go on, I mean, I..."
1856,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,What's the gun for Brian?
1857,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Just forget it...
1858,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"You brought it up, man!"
1859,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"I can't have an F, I can't have it and I know my parents can't have it! Even if I aced the rest of the semester, I'm still only a B. And everything's ruined for me!"
1860,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Oh Brian...
1861,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"So I considered my options, you know?"
1862,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,No! Killing yourself is not an option!
1863,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Well I didn't do it, did I? No, I don't think so!"
1864,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"No, it was a flare gun, went off in my locker."
1865,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Really?
1866,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,It's not funny...
1867,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was destroyed!
1868,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,No!
1869,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Brian?
1870,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Yeah?
1871,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Are you gonna write your paper?
1872,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Yeah, why?"
1873,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"Well, it's kinda a waste for all of us to write our paper, don't you think?"
1874,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Oh, but that's what Vernon wants us to do..."
1875,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"True, but I think we'd all kinda say the same thing."
1876,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,You just don't want to write your paper...Right?
1877,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"True, but, you're the smartest, right?"
1878,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Oh, well..."
1879,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,We trust you...
1880,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,Yeah...
1881,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"All right, I'll do it..."
1882,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Great...
1883,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Come on...
1884,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Come on!
1885,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Don't be afraid.
1886,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,"I'm not sticking it, just close... just go like that..."
1887,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Good...
1888,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,You know you really do look a lot better without all that black shit on your eyes...
1889,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,This looks a lot better...look up.
1890,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,'Cause you're letting me.
1891,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,You lost?
1892,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Cool!
1893,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Why'd you do that?
1894,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,'Cause I knew you wouldn't.
1895,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,"You know how you said before, how your parents used you to get back at each other...wouldn't I be outstanding in that capacity?"
1896,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Were you really disgusted about what I did with my lipstick?
1897,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,Truth?
1898,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,Truth...
1899,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,No... CUT TO:
1900,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,What happened to you?
1901,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,"Nothing's wrong, it's just so different. I can see your face."
1902,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,It's good!
1903,Breakfast-Club-The,CARL,See ya Brian...
1904,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,Hey Carl...
1905,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,See you next Saturday...
1906,Breakfast-Club-The,CARL,You bet! CUT TO:
1907,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. But we think you're crazy to make an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see us... In the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. CUT TO:"
1908,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain...
1909,Breakfast-Club-The,ANDREW,...and an athlete...
1910,Breakfast-Club-The,CLAIRE,...a princess...
1911,Breakfast-Club-The,BENDER,...and a criminal...
1912,Breakfast-Club-The,BRIAN,"Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club."
1913,Cars-2,FINN,I'm looking for a car.
1914,Cars-2,FINN,Exactly where I want to be.
1915,Cars-2,FINN,"Leland Turbo, this is Finn McMissile. I'm at the rally point. Over."
1916,Cars-2,FINN,"Leland, it's Finn. Please respond. Over."
1917,Cars-2,FINN,Professor Zundapp?
1918,Cars-2,FINN,"What are you up to now, Professor?"
1919,Cars-2,MATER,"Mater. Tow Mater, that's who... is here to help you!"
1920,Cars-2,MATER,"Hey, Otis!"
1921,Cars-2,MATER,"Well dadgum, you're leaking oil again. Must be your gaskets. Hey, look on the bright side: This is your tenth tow this month, so that means it's on the house."
1922,Cars-2,MATER,"Don't sweat it. These things happen to everybody, Otis."
1923,Cars-2,MATER,"Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust is starting to show through."
1924,Cars-2,MATER,Not yet.
1925,Cars-2,MATER,"Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him. But I sure wish he'd hurry up and get back `cause we got a whole summer's worth of best friend fun to make up for. Just me and --"
1926,Cars-2,MATER,--- McQueen!
1927,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"It's good to be home, everybody."
1928,Cars-2,MATER,McQueen!
1929,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Mater!
1930,Cars-2,MATER,McQueen!
1931,Cars-2,MATER,"McQueen, welcome back!"
1932,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mater, it's so good to see you."
1933,Cars-2,MATER,"You too, buddy."
1934,Cars-2,MATER,"Oh, man. You ain't gonna believe the things I got planned for us."
1935,Cars-2,MATER,You ready to have some serious fun?
1936,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Well, actually I've got something to show you first."
1937,Cars-2,MATER,Wow. I can't believe they renamed the Piston Cup after our very own Doc Hudson.
1938,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"I know Doc said these things were just old cups, but to have someone else win it just didn't feel right, you know?"
1939,Cars-2,MATER,"Well, Doc would've been real proud of you. That's for sure."
1940,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Alright, pal. I've been waiting all summer for this. What've you got planned?"
1941,Cars-2,MATER,You sure you can handle it?
1942,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Come on, you know who you're talking to? This is Lightning McQueen. I can handle anything."
1943,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Uh.... Mater?!
1944,Cars-2,MATER,"Just remember, your brakes ain't gonna work on these!"
1945,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Mater!
1946,Cars-2,MATER,"Relax, these train tracks ain't been used in years!"
1947,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Come on, come on! Faster, faster!"
1948,Cars-2,MATER,This is gonna be good!
1949,Cars-2,MATER,Uh-oh. This ain't gonna be good.
1950,Cars-2,MATER,"Boy, this was the best day ever! And my favorite souvenir?"
1951,Cars-2,MATER,This new dent!
1952,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Boy, Mater. Today was, uh..."
1953,Cars-2,MATER,"Shoot, that was nothing. Wait til you see what I got planned for tonight."
1954,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mater, Mater. Whoa. I was kind of thinking of just a quiet dinner."
1955,Cars-2,MATER,That's exactly what I was thinking.
1956,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"No, I... I meant with Sally, Mater."
1957,Cars-2,MATER,"Even better! You, me and Miss Sally going out for supper."
1958,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mater, I meant it would be just me and Sally."
1959,Cars-2,MATER,Oh.
1960,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,It's just for tonight. We'll do whatever you want tomorrow.
1961,Cars-2,MATER,Okay.
1962,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Thanks for understanding.
1963,Cars-2,MATER,"Yeah, sure. Y'all go on and have fun now."
1964,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Alright, then. See ya soon, amigo!"
1965,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"I can't tell you how good it is to be here alone. Just the two of us. Finally, you and me ---"
1966,Cars-2,MATER,Good evening.
1967,Cars-2,MATER,My name is Mater and I'll be your waiter. Mater the waiter. That's funny right there.
1968,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mater, you work here?"
1969,Cars-2,MATER,"Well yeah I work here. What'd you think, I just snuck in here when nobody was looking and pretended to be your waiter, just so I could hang out with you?"
1970,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Oh, yeah. How ridiculous would that be?"
1971,Cars-2,MATER,"Now, can I start you two lovebirds off with a couple drinks?"
1972,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Yes. I'll have my usual.
1973,Cars-2,MATER,"Uh, right. Your usual. CUT TO:"
1974,Cars-2,MATER,Guido! What's McQueen's usual?
1975,Cars-2,MATER,Perfect! Give me two of `em.
1976,Cars-2,MATER,"What happened to the dinosaurs, now?"
1977,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Hey, what's going on over there? CUT BACK TO:"
1978,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Oh, it's that Italian Formula car. His name is ---"
1979,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Wait, why do you know his name? And don't say it like that. It's three syllables, not ten."
1980,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,What's wrong with fenders? I thought you like my fenders.
1981,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Mater?
1982,Cars-2,MATER,Ha ha! That shows what you know. Dump trucks is dumb.
1983,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Yeah, hi, this is Lightning McQueen. Look, I don't appreciate my best friend being insulted like that."
1984,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Those are strong words from a car that is so fragile.
1985,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"""Not so fast."" What is that, your new motto?"
1986,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Well, I would love to. The only thing is my crew's off for the season so ---"
1987,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"You know what? They just got back. Deal me in, baby. Ka-chow!"
1988,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"I know, I know. I just got back. But we won't be long and ---"
1989,Cars-2,MATER,"Your drinks, sir."
1990,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Mater.
1991,Cars-2,MATER,I didn't taste it!
1992,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,How'd you like to come and see the world with me?
1993,Cars-2,MATER,You mean it?
1994,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,You got me into this thing. You're coming along.
1995,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Hey, look at this. Okay now Mater, remember: best behavior."
1996,Cars-2,MATER,"You got it, buddy. Hey, what's that?"
1997,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Mater!
1998,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Hey, Jeff. Lewis! CUT TO:"
1999,Cars-2,MATER,Hey! You done good! You got all the leaves!
2000,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Will you guys excuse me just for one little second?
2001,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mater, listen. This isn't Radiator Springs."
2002,Cars-2,MATER,"You're just realizing that? Boy, that jet-lag really done a number on you."
2003,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mater, look -- things are different over here. Which means maybe you should, you know, act a little different too."
2004,Cars-2,MATER,Different than what?
2005,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Well, just... help me out here, buddy. I ---"
2006,Cars-2,MATER,"You need help? Shoot, why didn't you just say so? That's what a tow truck does. Hey, looky there, it's Mr. San Francisco!"
2007,Cars-2,MATER,I'll introduce you.
2008,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mater, no."
2009,Cars-2,MATER,Look at me -- I'm helping you already!
2010,Cars-2,MATER,"Hey Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you to meet ---"
2011,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Nice to meet you, Francesco."
2012,Cars-2,MATER,Excuse me. Can I get a picture with you?
2013,Cars-2,MATER,Miss Sally is gonna flip when she sees this. She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend.
2014,Cars-2,MATER,She's a big fan of yours.
2015,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mater's prone to exaggeration. I wouldn't say she's a ""big"" fan."
2016,Cars-2,MATER,You're right. She's a huge fan. She goes on and on about your open wheels here.
2017,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mentioning it once doesn't qualify as going ""on and on."""
2018,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Yeah, uh..."
2019,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Let's.
2020,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY win tomorrow to her. So if we both do it, it's really not so special. Besides, I don't have a drink."
2021,Cars-2,MATER,I'll go get you one. You mind if I borrow a few bucks for one of them drinks?
2022,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"They're free, Mater."
2023,Cars-2,MATER,"Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing here?"
2024,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,I should probably go keep an eye on him. See you at the race.
2025,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,That's cute. So you had one of those made up for all the racers?
2026,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Okay.
2027,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,He is so getting beat tomorrow.
2028,Cars-2,HOLLEY,A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator.
2029,Cars-2,FINN,That's because it's air-cooled.
2030,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"I'm Agent Shiftwell, Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo Station. I have a message from London."
2031,Cars-2,FINN,Not here. You must try the canapes on the mezzanine!
2032,Cars-2,FINN,So the lab boys analyzed the photo I sent? What did they learn about the camera?
2033,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"It appears to be a standard television camera. They said if you could get closer photos next time, that would be great."
2034,Cars-2,FINN,This was London's message?
2035,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Oh -- no, no. No sir. Um, the oil platforms you were on? Turns out they're sitting on the biggest oil reserve in the world."
2036,Cars-2,FINN,How did we miss that?
2037,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"They'd been scrambling everyone's satellites. The Americans actually discovered it just before you did. They placed an agent on that platform, under deep cover. He was able to get a photo of the car who's running the entire operation."
2038,Cars-2,FINN,Who is it? Has anyone seen the photo yet?
2039,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"No, not yet. The American is here tonight to pass it to you. He'll signal you when he's ready."
2040,Cars-2,FINN,GOOD ---
2041,Cars-2,FINN,Oh no.
2042,Cars-2,HOLLEY,What is it?
2043,Cars-2,FINN,Change of plan. You're meeting the American.
2044,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"What, me?"
2045,Cars-2,FINN,"Those thugs down there were on the oil platform. If they see me, the whole mission is compromised."
2046,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"No, no. I'm technical, you see. I'm in Diagnostics. I'm not a field agent."
2047,Cars-2,FINN,You are now. CUT TO:
2048,Cars-2,MATER,I'll take one of them.
2049,Cars-2,MATER,Never know which one McQueen'll have a hankering for.
2050,Cars-2,MATER,"Hey, what you got here that's free? How about that pistachio ice cream?"
2051,Cars-2,MATER,"Oh, same ol', same ol'. What's up with you? That looks delicious."
2052,Cars-2,MATER,"Uh, a little more, please. It is free, right? Keep it coming. A little more. Come on, let's go, it's free! You're getting there... Scoop scoop!"
2053,Cars-2,MATER,There you go. Now THAT's a scoop of ice cream.
2054,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Thank you so much for having us, Sir Axlerod. I really look forward to racing. This is a great opportunity."
2055,Cars-2,MATER,Somebody get me water!
2056,Cars-2,MATER,Sweet relief...
2057,Cars-2,MATER,"Whatever you do, do not eat the free pistachio ice cream. It has turned!"
2058,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Sir Axlerod, I can explain. This is Mater."
2059,Cars-2,MATER,"No, thank you. This trip's been amazing."
2060,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Mater!
2061,Cars-2,MATER,"But wait, I... oh, shoot."
2062,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mater, you have to get a hold of yourself. You're making a scene."
2063,Cars-2,MATER,But I never leak oil. Never.
2064,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Go take care of yourself right now.
2065,Cars-2,MATER,"Coming through! Excuse me, leakin' oil. Where's the bathroom? Thank you. I gotta go!"
2066,Cars-2,MATER,What the...
2067,Cars-2,MATER,Sorry ladies!
2068,Cars-2,MATER,I never leak I never leak I never leak...
2069,Cars-2,MATER,Wowee...
2070,Cars-2,MATER,What in the---
2071,Cars-2,MATER,"Hey, that tickles."
2072,Cars-2,HOLLEY,The American has activated his tracking beacon.
2073,Cars-2,FINN,Roger that. Move in.
2074,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Oh, you've got to be joking."
2075,Cars-2,FINN,"What's the problem, Shiftwell?"
2076,Cars-2,HOLLEY,He's in the loo.
2077,Cars-2,FINN,So go in!
2078,Cars-2,HOLLEY,I can't just go into the men's loo.
2079,Cars-2,FINN,"Time is of the essence, Shiftwell."
2080,Cars-2,MATER,"Whatever you do, I would not go in there."
2081,Cars-2,MATER,A Gremlin and a Pacer!
2082,Cars-2,MATER,"No offense to your makes and models, but you guys break down harder than my cousin Betsy after she got left at the ---"
2083,Cars-2,MATER,--- altar!
2084,Cars-2,MATER,Are you okay?
2085,Cars-2,MATER,"Oh, yeah. Don't let me get in the way of your ""private business."" Oh! A little advice: When you hear her giggle and see that waterfall, you best press that green button."
2086,Cars-2,MATER,It's to adjust the temperature.
2087,Cars-2,MATER,"Remember it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit."
2088,Cars-2,MATER,Alright then.
2089,Cars-2,MATER,"Excuse me, ma'am."
2090,Cars-2,MATER,Dadgum pistachio ice cream.
2091,Cars-2,HOLLEY,This cannot be him.
2092,Cars-2,FINN,Is he American?
2093,Cars-2,MATER,"Look out, ladies. Mater's fittin' to get funky!"
2094,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Extremely.
2095,Cars-2,FINN,Then it's him.
2096,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Hello.
2097,Cars-2,MATER,"Well, hello."
2098,Cars-2,HOLLEY,A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator.
2099,Cars-2,MATER,Well of course it doesn't. That's `cause it's air-cooled!
2100,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Perfect. I'm from the Tokyo Station OF THE---
2101,Cars-2,MATER,"Course, Karmann Ghia's weren't the only ones. Besides the Beetles you had your Type-3 Squarebacks, with the pancake motors..."
2102,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Yeah. Okay, I get it---"
2103,Cars-2,MATER,"... And before both of them, there's the Type-2 buses - my buddy Fillmore's one of them."
2104,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Listen! We should find somewhere more private.
2105,Cars-2,MATER,"Uh, gee. Don't you think that's a little, uh ---"
2106,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"You're right. Impossible to know which areas here are compromised. So, when can I see you again?"
2107,Cars-2,MATER,"Well, let's see. Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races."
2108,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Got it. We'll rendezvous then.
2109,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,There you are. Where have you been?
2110,Cars-2,MATER,What's a rendezvous?
2111,Cars-2,MATER,A date?!
2112,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mater, what's going on?"
2113,Cars-2,MATER,"Well, what's going on is I've got me a date tomorrow."
2114,Cars-2,MATER,"Well, believe it. My new girlfriend just said so. Hey, there she is."
2115,Cars-2,MATER,Hey! Hey lady!
2116,Cars-2,MATER,See ya tomorrow!
2117,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Speed. I am speed.
2118,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,He is so getting beat today.
2119,Cars-2,MATER,And he's awesome! CUT TO:
2120,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Why is he in the pits? He's so exposed.
2121,Cars-2,FINN,"It's his cover. One of the best I've seen, too. Look at the detail on that rust. It must have cost him a fortune."
2122,Cars-2,HOLLEY,But why hasn't he contacted us yet?
2123,Cars-2,FINN,There's probably heat on him. Be patient.
2124,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Right, of course. He'll signal us when he can."
2125,Cars-2,FINN,And then we find out who's behind all this.
2126,Cars-2,MATER,McQueen! It's time to make your move. Get on the outside and show 'em what Doc done taught you.
2127,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Ten four, Mater."
2128,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Nice call, Mater. Keep it up!"
2129,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Hold on. I think I've got something.
2130,Cars-2,FINN,What is it?
2131,Cars-2,HOLLEY,The Pacer from the party last night.
2132,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Cross-referencing with the photos from the oil derricks... Yep. His VIN numbers match.
2133,Cars-2,FINN,Anyone with him? He won't be alone.
2134,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Conducting analysis on the target.
2135,Cars-2,HOLLEY,He's not the only one here. Three... five... they're everywhere. And they're all closing in on... oh no.
2136,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Finn? Finn, where are you?"
2137,Cars-2,FINN,Get him out of the pits now!
2138,Cars-2,MATER,Wow! Some of them fellers is really loud.
2139,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Can you hear me? Over.
2140,Cars-2,MATER,"Uh, what?"
2141,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Get out of the pit now. Do you hear me?
2142,Cars-2,MATER,"Hey, I know you. You're that girl from the party last night. You wanna do our date right now?"
2143,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Guys, a little too much chatter. Let's keep this line clear."
2144,Cars-2,HOLLEY,There's no time for messing about. You've got to get out of the pits.
2145,Cars-2,MATER,Is there gonna be cable where you is so I can watch the rest of the race?
2146,Cars-2,HOLLEY,You're running out of time!
2147,Cars-2,FINN,"They're coming, Shiftwell."
2148,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Yes, I know."
2149,Cars-2,FINN,Get him out of there.
2150,Cars-2,HOLLEY,I'm trying. Get out now!
2151,Cars-2,MATER,"Well, all right but I usually like to have a proper detailing done before I meet a lady friend."
2152,Cars-2,FINN,Then this shouldn't hurt at all.
2153,Cars-2,FINN,Miss Shiftwell?
2154,Cars-2,HOLLEY,I've got him in the back alleys east of the garages. Multiple assailants are closing in quickly.
2155,Cars-2,FINN,Keep him moving. I'm on my way.
2156,Cars-2,MATER,"Hey, new lady friend? You like flowers?"
2157,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,What?
2158,Cars-2,HOLLEY,No! Don't go 'in' anywhere. Just keep moving.
2159,Cars-2,MATER,Stay outside. Gotcha.
2160,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Outside?
2161,Cars-2,HOLLEY,You're doing brilliantly. Now just stay focused.
2162,Cars-2,MATER,What's that? You want me to head toward that ruckus?
2163,Cars-2,HOLLEY,No! Don't go down that street!
2164,Cars-2,MATER,Wow! A live karate demonstration!
2165,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Stop it, Mater. Just sign off."
2166,Cars-2,MATER,"That was cool! Hey, can I get your autograph?"
2167,Cars-2,MATER,"Hey, where'd he go?"
2168,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Our rendezvous has been jeopardized. Keep the device safe. We'll be in touch.
2169,Cars-2,MATER,"Dadgum, did I miss our date?"
2170,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Mater.
2171,Cars-2,MATER,"Hey McQueen! What happened? Is the race over? You won, right?"
2172,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mater, why were you yelling things at me while I was racing?"
2173,Cars-2,MATER,"Yelling? Oh, you thought... that's funny right there. Nah, see that's `cause I seen these two fellers doing some sort of karate street performance. It was nutso. One of them even had a flamethrower ---"
2174,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,A flamethrower? What are you talking about? I don't understand. Where were you?
2175,Cars-2,MATER,Going to meet my date.
2176,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Your date?
2177,Cars-2,MATER,"She started talking to me as a voice in my head, telling me where to go ---"
2178,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,What?
2179,Cars-2,MATER,"Wait a minute -- I didn't screw you up, did I?"
2180,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,I lost the race because of you!
2181,Cars-2,MATER,"Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean ---"
2182,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"An imaginary girlfriend, flamethrowers. This is exactly why I don't bring you along to these things."
2183,Cars-2,MATER,"Maybe if I, I don't know, talked to somebody and explained what happened I could help."
2184,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,I don't need your help. I don't want your help.
2185,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"I made a mistake. But I can assure you, it won't happen again."
2186,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Look, guys. We know what the problem is and we've taken care of it. SMASH TO:"
2187,Cars-2,MATER,But I'm gonna miss my plane.
2188,Cars-2,MATER,"Doggone it. This is about my hook, isn't it? I know I should've checked it, but I can't really, look -- it's attached to me."
2189,Cars-2,MATER,"Hey, I know you. You're that feller from the karate demonstration."
2190,Cars-2,FINN,I never properly introduced myself. Finn McMissile. British Intelligence.
2191,Cars-2,MATER,Tow Mater. Average intelligence.
2192,Cars-2,FINN,"Who are you with? FBI, CIA?"
2193,Cars-2,MATER,"Let's just say I'm triple-A affiliated. You know, I know some karate. I don't wanna brag or nothing, but I've got me a black fan belt."
2194,Cars-2,MATER,"Hey, you wanna see some moves I made up?"
2195,Cars-2,FINN,You're being followed.
2196,Cars-2,MATER,"This first one I can reach into a car's hood, pull out his battery, and show it to him before he stalls. I call it, ""What I accidentally did to my friend Luigi once."""
2197,Cars-2,MATER,"Look, I probably ought to go. I'm about to miss my flight."
2198,Cars-2,FINN,Don't worry.
2199,Cars-2,FINN,I've taken care of that. Hang on.
2200,Cars-2,MATER,This is First Class service. You don't even have to go through the terminal.
2201,Cars-2,MATER,Your karate partners are back here. They kinda look like they're trying to catch up!
2202,Cars-2,FINN,"Drive forward. Whatever you do, don't stop."
2203,Cars-2,MATER,Is everything okay back there?
2204,Cars-2,FINN,Roger that.
2205,Cars-2,MATER,You remember that whole thing about me not stopping no matter what?
2206,Cars-2,MATER,I knew I should've done carry-on!
2207,Cars-2,FINN,"Thanks, old boy!"
2208,Cars-2,MATER,"Hey, doggone it. It's my imaginary girlfriend!"
2209,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Come on! Get in here!
2210,Cars-2,MATER,"Boy I tell you what, you really do want this first date, don't ya? That's a no-quit attitude right there."
2211,Cars-2,FINN,"Hold on, Sid!"
2212,Cars-2,MATER,"By the time you read this, I will be safely on an airplane, flying home."
2213,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"""I'm so sorry for what I did. I don't want to be the cause of you losing any more races. I want you to go prove to the world what I already know - that you are the greatest race car in the whole wide world. Your best friend, Mater."""
2214,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,I didn't really want him to leave.
2215,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Well, at least I know if he's at home he'll be safe."
2216,Cars-2,FINN,Now that's how I like to start the day! You never feel more alive than when you're almost dead.
2217,Cars-2,HOLLEY,I hope that device didn't fall off.
2218,Cars-2,MATER,That's the closest I ever been to missing my flight! That was ---
2219,Cars-2,MATER,Yow!
2220,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Still in one piece, great."
2221,Cars-2,MATER,I gotta go to a doctor. I keep getting these sharp pains in my undercarriage.
2222,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Downloading the photo now.
2223,Cars-2,MATER,"Hey, lemme introduce you two. This here is Finn McSomething-or- other. He's a First Class VIP airport whatchamacallit. And Finn, this here's my date. I never did get your name."
2224,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Oh yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell. Holley Shiftwell."
2225,Cars-2,MATER,It's Shiftwell. Holley ---
2226,Cars-2,FINN,Finally. Time to see who's behind all this.
2227,Cars-2,HOLLEY,What is this?
2228,Cars-2,MATER,"Well, that's one of the worst engines ever made. It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical system and Whitworth bolts. Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain, tell you what. Them ain't metric, they ain't inches..."
2229,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Yes, OK, right. But who's engine is this, Mater?"
2230,Cars-2,MATER,"Well, it's kinda hard to tell from this picture, ain't it?"
2231,Cars-2,HOLLEY,But you're the one who took it.
2232,Cars-2,FINN,Holley.
2233,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Oh, right. Yes, of course. ""A good agent gets what he can, then gets out before he's killed."" Sorry."
2234,Cars-2,MATER,"Agent? You mean like insurance agent, like, `Like a good neighbor, Mater is there'? Wait, you mean secret agents. You guys is spies!"
2235,Cars-2,FINN,"Holley, in how many makes and models did this type of engine appear?"
2236,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"It was standard in seven models over a 12-year period. At least 35,000 cars were made with this engine."
2237,Cars-2,MATER,You're pretty.
2238,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Yes, alright. Thank you."
2239,Cars-2,MATER,And so nice.
2240,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Just pay attention.
2241,Cars-2,FINN,This seems like a dead end. If there were something in the photo that could narrow this down a bit I'd be a lot happier.
2242,Cars-2,MATER,"You might not be happy, but I bet this feller is. See how he's had most of his parts replaced? And see all them boxes over there? Them's all original parts. They ain't easy to come by."
2243,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Rare parts.
2244,Cars-2,FINN,That's something we can track.
2245,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Exactly!
2246,Cars-2,FINN,"Well done, Mater! I would never have seen that. I know of a black-market parts dealer in Paris, a treacherous lowlife. But, he's the only car in the world who can tell us whose engine this is. Mater, what would you say to setting up an informal task force on this one?"
2247,Cars-2,MATER,"Wait, what?"
2248,Cars-2,FINN,You obviously have plenty of experience in the field.
2249,Cars-2,MATER,"Well yeah I live right next to one. I don't know, Finn. I ain't exactly been much help to anybody recently."
2250,Cars-2,FINN,"You're helping me. Please, Mater."
2251,Cars-2,MATER,"Well, okay. But you know I'm just a tow truck, right?"
2252,Cars-2,FINN,Right. And I'm just in the import/export business. Siddeley?
2253,Cars-2,FINN,Paris. Tout de suite.
2254,Cars-2,MATER,"Yeah, two of them sweets for me too, Sid! You know, I always wanted to be a spy."
2255,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Really? Me too.
2256,Cars-2,FINN,Is there any other way?
2257,Cars-2,FINN,"Once we're inside, stay close. Don't bother checking VIN numbers for criminal records, they're all dodgy here."
2258,Cars-2,HOLLEY,No VIN scans. Got it.
2259,Cars-2,FINN,"Don't talk to anyone. Don't look at anyone. And absolutely, positively no idling. Are we clear?"
2260,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Yes, right. No idling. Yes, sir."
2261,Cars-2,FINN,Mater?
2262,Cars-2,MATER,"Yeah, Finn?"
2263,Cars-2,FINN,We're not here to go shopping.
2264,Cars-2,MATER,Shopping? What do you mean? Why would I ---
2265,Cars-2,MATER,Dadgum.
2266,Cars-2,MATER,You gotta be kidding me - they've got everything here. Look at them hoods! I could use a hood.
2267,Cars-2,MATER,"Sorry fellers, I gotta go."
2268,Cars-2,MATER,Excuse me. What are you selling?
2269,Cars-2,FINN,There you are.
2270,Cars-2,MATER,"Man, there are some great ---"
2271,Cars-2,FINN,"Mater, get back!"
2272,Cars-2,MATER,"Hey, wait for me!"
2273,Cars-2,FINN,Have you lost your mind?!
2274,Cars-2,HOLLEY,But I thought ---
2275,Cars-2,FINN,Mater! This chap needs a tow. Hook him up.
2276,Cars-2,MATER,Sure thing. CUT TO:
2277,Cars-2,FINN,Allez! Maintenant - vite!
2278,Cars-2,FINN,"Easy, Tomber. This is her first field assignment - she didn't know you were my informant."
2279,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Informant?
2280,Cars-2,FINN,"Tomber was doing 20 to life in a Moroccan impound the first time I saved him, if I recall correctly."
2281,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Alright, we get it. You both know each other, you're both old. So."
2282,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"There you go, informant. Inform us."
2283,Cars-2,FINN,"Do those parts look familiar, Tomber?"
2284,Cars-2,HOLLEY,To whom?
2285,Cars-2,MATER,"Well, a lemon needs parts. Ain't nothing truer than that."
2286,Cars-2,FINN,"""Lemon?"""
2287,Cars-2,MATER,"Yeah, you know. Cars that don't ever work right. Lemons is a tow truck's bread and butter. Like them Gremlins and Pacers we run into at the party and the race and the airport."
2288,Cars-2,FINN,"Holley, pull up the pictures from the oil platform. I want to know what other type of cars were out there."
2289,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Right. Let's see. There were Hugos. And Trunkovs.
2290,Cars-2,FINN,"Mater, are these cars considered lemons?"
2291,Cars-2,MATER,Is the Popemobile Catholic?
2292,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Finn. Everyone involved in this plot is one of history's biggest loser cars.
2293,Cars-2,FINN,And they're all taking their orders from the car behind this engine.
2294,Cars-2,FINN,"What, Tomber?"
2295,Cars-2,FINN,Where's this meeting taking place?
2296,Cars-2,MATER,That's where the next race is!
2297,Cars-2,FINN,Then there's a good chance our mystery engine will be there too.
2298,Cars-2,FINN,"Holley, contact Stephenson and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon. Good work."
2299,Cars-2,MATER,"Boy, I'll tell you what. That three- wheeled feller had to be right about a big meeting."
2300,Cars-2,MATER,"You never see this many lemons in one town. Unless there's a swap meet, or something."
2301,Cars-2,MATER,"Hey, how'd you get all them pictures?"
2302,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Well, I remotely reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light cameras to do recognition scans."
2303,Cars-2,MATER,"Wow, not only is you the prettiest car I ever met, but you the smartest too."
2304,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Thank you. I think.
2305,Cars-2,MATER,That's a familiar sight.
2306,Cars-2,MATER,A Hugo being towed. But he looks absolutely perfect.
2307,Cars-2,FINN,Of course. They must be the heads of the lemon families.
2308,Cars-2,MATER,"Makes sense. If I was rich and broke down every day, I'd hire me to tow me around all the time too."
2309,Cars-2,FINN,We've got to infiltrate that meeting. It's the only way to find out who's behind all this.
2310,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Hang on a minute.
2311,Cars-2,MATER,What?
2312,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Hold still.
2313,Cars-2,MATER,Ahh!
2314,Cars-2,FINN,"Good job, Miss Shiftwell."
2315,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Thank you, Finn."
2316,Cars-2,MATER,"Boy, I sure wish my friends could see me now."
2317,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"No, Mama Topolino, please. You don't need to make a fuss!"
2318,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,How'd you know that?
2319,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"I brought my friend Mater along on the trip. And I told him he needed to act different, that we weren't in Radiator Springs."
2320,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,He's my best friend.
2321,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,What did I do? I said some things during our fight...
2322,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,What does that mean?
2323,Cars-2,FINN,"Thank you, Stephenson."
2324,Cars-2,HOLLEY,That should just about do it.
2325,Cars-2,FINN,Perfect.
2326,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"So Mater, it's voice-activated. But you know, everything's voice- activated these days."
2327,Cars-2,MATER,What? I thought you was supposed to be making me a disguise.
2328,Cars-2,MATER,"Cool! Hey, computer. Make me a German truck!"
2329,Cars-2,MATER,Check it out. I'm wearing Materhosen. Make me a monster truck!
2330,Cars-2,MATER,I vant to siphon your gas. Now make me a taco truck!
2331,Cars-2,MATER,A funny car!
2332,Cars-2,FINN,"The idea is to keep a low profile, Mater."
2333,Cars-2,MATER,"So I just go in, pretend to be this truck."
2334,Cars-2,FINN,And leave the rest to us.
2335,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Now hold still.
2336,Cars-2,HOLLEY,I have to do the final fitting on your disguise.
2337,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Oh dear. That's no good.
2338,Cars-2,MATER,"Hey, what are you doing?"
2339,Cars-2,HOLLEY,The disguise won't calibrate effectively without a smooth surface to graft onto.
2340,Cars-2,MATER,Oh. For a second there I thought you was trying to fix my dents.
2341,Cars-2,HOLLEY,I was.
2342,Cars-2,MATER,"Well then no thank you. I don't get them dents buffed, pulled, filled or painted by nobody. They're way too valuable."
2343,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Your dents are valuable?
2344,Cars-2,MATER,I come by each one of them with my best friend Lightning McQueen.
2345,Cars-2,MATER,I don't fix these. I want to remember these dents forever.
2346,Cars-2,HOLLEY,So you were being serious in Paris? McQueen isn't just part of your cover?
2347,Cars-2,FINN,"Friendships can be dangerous in our line of work, Mater."
2348,Cars-2,MATER,But my line of work is towing and salvage.
2349,Cars-2,FINN,Right. And Miss Shiftwell's is designing iPhone apps.
2350,Cars-2,MATER,"No, I meant for real. I ---"
2351,Cars-2,HOLLEY,It's okay. Say no more. I'll work around the dent.
2352,Cars-2,FINN,In the meantime...
2353,Cars-2,FINN,You look a little light on weapons.
2354,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"No, guys, I just really wish Mater were here."
2355,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Oh, great. Here it comes. What've you got, Francesco?"
2356,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,I think you forgot the insulting part of that insult.
2357,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Gee, I maybe misjudged you, because that's exactly how I ---"
2358,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,And there's the insult we were missing. Grazie!
2359,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Scusatemi, tutti! Signori!"
2360,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Mio nonno, my grandfather, has broken down. If one of you would help I would be so thankful."
2361,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"No, no, don't fight over me."
2362,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Signore Tow Truck, per favore? CUT TO:"
2363,Cars-2,FINN,"Get ready, Mater. CUT TO:"
2364,Cars-2,FINN,You're on any moment now. CUT BACK TO:
2365,Cars-2,MATER,"I don't know about this, Finn. What if I screw things up?"
2366,Cars-2,FINN,"Impossible. Just apply the same level of dedication you've been using to play the ""idiot tow truck"" and you'll be fine."
2367,Cars-2,MATER,"It's just that them guys look pretty tough and --- Wait, did you say ""idiot""? Is that how you see me?"
2368,Cars-2,FINN,"That's how everyone sees you. Isn't that the idea? I tell you, that's the genius of it. No one realizes they're being fooled because they're too busy laughing at the fool. Brilliant."
2369,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Why aren't you in disguise?
2370,Cars-2,MATER,"I, uh---"
2371,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Come on, there's no time. Go!"
2372,Cars-2,MATER,"Okay, okay. Computer: disguise."
2373,Cars-2,HOLLEY,He's in.
2374,Cars-2,MATER,"Wow, this place looks like it's made out of gold."
2375,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"That's because it is, Mater. Now, be careful what you say."
2376,Cars-2,MATER,Why is that? What do you mean don't talk to you? So you want me to stop talking to you. Right now?
2377,Cars-2,MATER,I have no idea what you're talking about...
2378,Cars-2,MATER,"...Alexander Hugo, aka ""Chop Shop Alex."""
2379,Cars-2,MATER,"Hey, you got a lot of aka's, Alex. But I guess that makes sense seeings how you's wanted in France, Germany, the Czech Republic..."
2380,Cars-2,HOLLEY,(cutting in to his
2381,Cars-2,FINN,He's so good.
2382,Cars-2,FINN,Here we go.
2383,Cars-2,FINN,Descramble that voice!
2384,Cars-2,HOLLEY,I'm trying... It's too sophisticated!
2385,Cars-2,FINN,What just happened?
2386,Cars-2,HOLLEY,I'm working on it.
2387,Cars-2,FINN,Holley?
2388,Cars-2,HOLLEY,I'm detecting an extremely strong electromagnetic pulse.
2389,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Finn, it's the camera!"
2390,Cars-2,FINN,Where?
2391,Cars-2,HOLLEY,On the tower.
2392,Cars-2,FINN,Get out of the way! Andate!
2393,Cars-2,FINN,No!
2394,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Finn.
2395,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Yeah!
2396,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"That's what I'm talking about. Kachow! Hey, where are all the other cars?"
2397,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Oh no. CUT TO:
2398,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Mater. Abort the mission. They've got Finn. Get out of there. Get out of there right now!
2399,Cars-2,MATER,"Oh yeah, it's unbelievable."
2400,Cars-2,MATER,"Uh, of course I ain't leavin'."
2401,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,I'm just in shock like everybody...
2402,Cars-2,MATER,McQueen?
2403,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Crashes are part of racing, I know. But something like that shouldn't ever happen."
2404,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Allinol.
2405,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,My friend Fillmore says the fuel's safe. That's good enough for me. I didn't stand by a friend of mine recently. I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
2406,Cars-2,MATER,No!
2407,Cars-2,MATER,Dadgum.
2408,Cars-2,MATER,Shoot. I didn't mean ---
2409,Cars-2,MATER,Whoa!!
2410,Cars-2,MATER,Wait wait! I didn't mean that kind of shoot!
2411,Cars-2,MATER,McQueen!
2412,Cars-2,MATER,Lemme through! Lemme through!
2413,Cars-2,MATER,You gotta let me in! I gotta get through to warn McQueen!
2414,Cars-2,MATER,"No, listen! I was disguised as a tow truck to infiltrate this Lemonhead meeting and my weapons system misinterperated what I was SAYING ---"
2415,Cars-2,MATER,McQueen! McQueen!
2416,Cars-2,MATER,McQueen!
2417,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Mater?
2418,Cars-2,MATER,McQueen!
2419,Cars-2,MATER,McQueen!
2420,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,That really sounded like Mater. Mater?
2421,Cars-2,MATER,"McQueen, they're gonna kill you!!"
2422,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Mater?!
2423,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Excuse me.
2424,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Scusi. Mater! Scusi...
2425,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mater, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so sorr ---"
2426,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I heard---"
2427,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"What? Oh. I mean, thanks."
2428,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,I really thought I heard my friend.
2429,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Wait, what?"
2430,Cars-2,MATER,Let me go!
2431,Cars-2,MATER,Idiot? Is that how you see me?
2432,Cars-2,FINN,"That's how everyone sees you. I tell you, that's the genius of it."
2433,Cars-2,FINN,No one realizes they're being fooled because they're too busy laughing at the fool.
2434,Cars-2,MATER,Domo arigato!
2435,Cars-2,MATER,You done good! You got all the leaves!
2436,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Will you guys excuse me just for one little second?
2437,Cars-2,MATER,Now that's a scoop of ice cream!
2438,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Mater?!
2439,Cars-2,MATER,I never leak oil. Never.
2440,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mater, you have to get a hold of yourself. You're making a scene!"
2441,Cars-2,MATER,"Wait a minute. I didn't screw you up, did I?"
2442,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,I lost the race because of you!
2443,Cars-2,MATER,"Maybe if I talked to somebody, or---"
2444,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,I don't need your help. I don't want your help!
2445,Cars-2,MATER,"Bang a gong, get it on!"
2446,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs. This is exactly why I don't bring you along to these things!"
2447,Cars-2,MATER,Holley! Finn! Where are we?
2448,Cars-2,FINN,"We're in London, Mater. Inside Big Bentley."
2449,Cars-2,MATER,Woaaaah! ---
2450,Cars-2,MATER,This... this is all my fault.
2451,Cars-2,FINN,"Don't be a fool, Mater."
2452,Cars-2,MATER,"But I am, remember? You said so."
2453,Cars-2,FINN,"When did I... Oh. Mater, I was complimenting you on what a good spy you are."
2454,Cars-2,MATER,I'm not a spy!
2455,Cars-2,MATER,I've been trying to tell you that the whole time. I really am just a tow truck.
2456,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Finn, he's not joking."
2457,Cars-2,FINN,I know.
2458,Cars-2,MATER,"You were right, Finn. I'm a fool. And what's happened to McQueen is `cause I'm such a big one. This is all my fault."
2459,Cars-2,MATER,He's still alive?
2460,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,I called to talk to Mater. It never occurred to me that he wouldn't be there.
2461,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"I know, but Sal, with everything going on I'm not sure I should---"
2462,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Sir Axlerod.
2463,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"No, no, it's all right."
2464,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Listen, I ---"
2465,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,All right. For Mater.
2466,Cars-2,MATER,Backup plan??
2467,Cars-2,MATER,Dadgum lemons.
2468,Cars-2,FINN,"Nice try, Mater."
2469,Cars-2,MATER,Dadgum!
2470,Cars-2,MATER,Dadgum! Dadgum! Dadgum!
2471,Cars-2,MATER,DADGUMDADGUMDADGUMDADGUM ---
2472,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Mater!
2473,Cars-2,MATER,I gotta get you all out of there!
2474,Cars-2,FINN,"There's no time. McQueen needs your help, Mater."
2475,Cars-2,MATER,"But I can't, I'm just a tow truck."
2476,Cars-2,FINN,It's up to you. Go to the pits and get everyone out. You can do that.
2477,Cars-2,MATER,What about you guys?
2478,Cars-2,FINN,We'll be okay.
2479,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Go and get some more dents, Mater."
2480,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"So we'll be ""okay""? Really?"
2481,Cars-2,FINN,"He wouldn't have left if I'd told him the truth. Being killed by a clock. Gives a whole new meaning to ""your time has come."""
2482,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Time. That's it!
2483,Cars-2,FINN,What are you doing?
2484,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Trying to turn back time. If I can just reverse the polarity...
2485,Cars-2,FINN,"Good job! Quick thinking, Holley!"
2486,Cars-2,MATER,What's everybody on the wrong side of the road for?!
2487,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Oh no!
2488,Cars-2,FINN,Drive!
2489,Cars-2,FINN,Burn rubber!!
2490,Cars-2,FINN,We've got to get to the course. Calculate the fastest way to ---
2491,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Done.
2492,Cars-2,FINN,Miss Shiftwell.
2493,Cars-2,HOLLEY,They're standard issue now.
2494,Cars-2,FINN,You kids get all the good hardware.
2495,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Oh no. That's Mater's.
2496,Cars-2,FINN,I knew his escape was too easy.
2497,Cars-2,MATER,Everybody get out! Get out now! Y'all gotta get out the pits!
2498,Cars-2,MATER,"Hey, what are you guys doing here?"
2499,Cars-2,MATER,No! Everything's not okay! There's a bomb in here! Y'all gotta get out! Now!
2500,Cars-2,FINN,Mater!
2501,Cars-2,MATER,Finn! You're okay!
2502,Cars-2,FINN,"Mater, listen to me. The bomb is on you."
2503,Cars-2,FINN,They knew you'd try to help McQueen. When we were knocked out they planted it in your air filter.
2504,Cars-2,MATER,Uh-oh.
2505,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Mater! There you are!
2506,Cars-2,MATER,Stop right there!
2507,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Oh man, I've been so worried about you! CUT TO:"
2508,Cars-2,MATER,Don't come any closer!
2509,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Are you okay?
2510,Cars-2,MATER,"No, I'm not okay. Stay away from me!!"
2511,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"No, wait. Wait! CUT TO:"
2512,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mater, wait!"
2513,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mater, wait!"
2514,Cars-2,MATER,"Stay back! If you get close to me, you gonna get hurt real bad!"
2515,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"I know I made you feel that way before, but none of that matters because we're best friends! CUT TO:"
2516,Cars-2,MATER,"McQueen, you don't get it. I'm the bomb!"
2517,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Yes, Mater! You are the bomb! That's what I'm trying to say here. You've always been the bomb! And you'll always be the bomb."
2518,Cars-2,MATER,Stay away!
2519,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,No! Never!
2520,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,I'm not...letting you...
2521,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,...get away again!
2522,Cars-2,MATER,Gotta keep away from McQueen.
2523,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Oh my gosh!
2524,Cars-2,FINN,"Holley. I'll get Zundapp, you help Mater."
2525,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Got it!
2526,Cars-2,FINN,"Do you really think I'm going to let you float away, Professor?"
2527,Cars-2,MATER,"McQueen, let go!"
2528,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Never!
2529,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Mater, stop!"
2530,Cars-2,MATER,No way! You could get hurt!
2531,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Oh no.
2532,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Mater, we've got to get that bomb off you."
2533,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Bomb?
2534,Cars-2,MATER,"Yeah, they strapped it to me to kill you as a back-up plan."
2535,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Back-up plan? Mater, who put a bomb on you?"
2536,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Death ray?
2537,Cars-2,FINN,"Turn off the bomb, Zundapp!"
2538,Cars-2,MATER,Deactivate! Deactivate!
2539,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Say it!
2540,Cars-2,FINN,You read my mind.
2541,Cars-2,HOLLEY,He was getting on my nerves.
2542,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,What do we do?
2543,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"I'm gonna go out on a limb here. These are the guys that want me dead, correct?"
2544,Cars-2,MATER,"Fellers, listen."
2545,Cars-2,MATER,I know what you're going through. Everybody's been laughing at me my whole life too ---
2546,Cars-2,MATER,--- but becoming powerful and rich beyond your wildest dreams ain't gonna make you feel better.
2547,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,What's he saying?! What's wrong!?
2548,Cars-2,MATER,I get it. I get it! I know what needs to be done.
2549,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Then do it!
2550,Cars-2,MATER,"What? No, I can't do it. Look, nobody takes me seriously. I know that now. This ain't Radiator Springs."
2551,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Yes it is.
2552,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"You're yourself in Radiator Springs. Be yourself here. And if people aren't taking you seriously, then they need to change. Not you. I know that, because I was wrong before. Now you can do this. You're the bomb."
2553,Cars-2,MATER,"Thanks, buddy."
2554,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"No no no, you're the actual bomb. Now let's go!"
2555,Cars-2,MATER,"Oh, right! Hang on!"
2556,Cars-2,FINN,Where's he going?
2557,Cars-2,MATER,Computer!
2558,Cars-2,MATER,I need that thing you done before to get me away from McQueen!
2559,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Mater...
2560,Cars-2,MATER,"Now I need you to do the chute, the second kind not the first!"
2561,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"No, no, it's okay! Tell them, Mater. Explain."
2562,Cars-2,MATER,Okay! Somebody's been sabotaging the racers and hurting the cars and I know who. Oh wait... Your Majesty.
2563,Cars-2,FINN,Hold your fire! He can't disarm it!
2564,Cars-2,FINN,"Mater, I don't know what you're doing but stand down now!"
2565,Cars-2,MATER,This ain't nothing at all like Radiator Springs.
2566,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mater, just cut to the chase!"
2567,Cars-2,MATER,Okay.
2568,Cars-2,MATER,It's him.
2569,Cars-2,MATER,I figured it out when I realized you all attached this ticking time bomb with Whitworth bolts. The same bolts that hold together that old British engine from the photograph. Holley! Show that picture.
2570,Cars-2,HOLLEY,O-kay...
2571,Cars-2,MATER,"And then I remembered what they say about old British engines - ""If there ain't no oil under `em, there ain't no oil in `em."""
2572,Cars-2,MATER,It was you leaking oil at the party in Japan. You just blamed it on me.
2573,Cars-2,MATER,Then you're faking it. You didn't convert to no electric. We pop that hood we gonna see that engine from that picture right there.
2574,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"But Sir Axlerod created the race, Mater. Why would he want to hurt anyone?"
2575,Cars-2,MATER,"To make Allinol look bad so everybody'd go back to using oil. I mean, he said it himself with that disguised voice."
2576,Cars-2,FINN,"Mater, he created Allinol."
2577,Cars-2,MATER,"Yeah, but what if he found that huge oil field just as the world was trying to find something else?"
2578,Cars-2,MATER,What if he came up with Allinol just to make alternative fuel look bad?
2579,Cars-2,FINN,Mater!
2580,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Mater!
2581,Cars-2,FINN,The engine from the photo.
2582,Cars-2,HOLLEY,It's a perfect match!
2583,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,It's official. You're coming to all my races from now on.
2584,Cars-2,MATER,Now you're talking!
2585,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Mater, let's go. You're on."
2586,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Go get `em, buddy."
2587,Cars-2,MATER,"""Sir?"" Shoot, you can just call me Mater, Your Majesty. I don't wanna hear none of this ""Sir"" business. By the way, have y'all met each other? Queen? McQueen. McQueen, Queen. McQueen? McMissile."
2588,Cars-2,MATER,"McMissile, McQueen. Queen? McMissile."
2589,Cars-2,MATER,"So there I was: rocket jets going full blast, McQueen hanging on for dear life when suddenly them two nasty lemons come out of nowhere, guns drawed. We was goners. But then out of nowhere, this beautiful spy car swoops in from the sky to save us!"
2590,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"No, you're quite right. It does sound a bit far-fetched."
2591,Cars-2,MATER,Holley! Finn!
2592,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Hello, Mater. It's so nice to see you again."
2593,Cars-2,MATER,What're you doing here?
2594,Cars-2,FINN,Our satellites picked up an urgent communique.
2595,Cars-2,MATER,"Oh, man. Y'all is gonna have a great time. Everybody! This here's Finn McMissile. He's a secret agent. Don't tell nobody. And this is Holley Shiftwell. She's ---"
2596,Cars-2,HOLLEY,I'm Mater's girlfriend. It's so nice to meet you all.
2597,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Oh no no. I'm keeping that dent. It's way too valuable.
2598,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"You know, there's one thing I still don't get. The bad guys hit me with the beam from the camera, right? So why didn't I, you know..."
2599,Cars-2,MATER,Explode in a fiery inferno?
2600,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Yeah.
2601,Cars-2,FINN,We couldn't figure that one out either.
2602,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Our investigation proved that Allinol was actually gasoline. And Miles Axlerod engineered it so that when it got hit by the beam it would explode.
2603,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"Wait a second. Fillmore, you said my fuel was safe."
2604,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"I just figured, we never found out who the world's fastest car is. Plus: no press, no trophy. Just racing - the way I like it."
2605,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Francesco. I'd like you to meet ---
2606,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,It's just something I had made up for the occasion.
2607,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,Yeah. Nice try.
2608,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"That's why I love you, Sally. Wish me luck."
2609,Cars-2,MATER,Go McQueen!! Whoo-hoo!!!
2610,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"Finn, time to go. Siddeley's gassed, geared and ready to fly."
2611,Cars-2,MATER,You're leaving already?
2612,Cars-2,FINN,"We've got another mission, Mater. Just stopped by here to ""pick something up."""
2613,Cars-2,MATER,Something tells me you're not talking about souvenir bumper stickers.
2614,Cars-2,FINN,"Her Majesty asked for you personally, Mater."
2615,Cars-2,MATER,But I told you all before. I'm not a spy.
2616,Cars-2,HOLLEY,We know.
2617,Cars-2,FINN,"Spy or not, you're still the smartest, most honest chap we've ever met."
2618,Cars-2,HOLLEY,Don't forget massively charming.
2619,Cars-2,MATER,"Well, thanks. But as much fun as it was hanging with y'all, this..."
2620,Cars-2,MATER,This is home.
2621,Cars-2,HOLLEY,"That's alright, we understand. But I'll be back. You still owe me that first date."
2622,Cars-2,FINN,"If there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know."
2623,Cars-2,MATER,"Well, I sure appreciate that, thank you. Actually... there is one thing. CUT TO:"
2624,Cars-2,MATER,Whoo-hoo!!!

2627,Cars-2,MCQUEEN,"I'll see you at the finish line, buddy!"
2628,Cars-2,MATER,Not if I see you first!
2629,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Come on idiot Why do you always have to be so selfish! You only think about yourself. Why can't you ever do as you're told!
2630,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,If dad wasn't fighting and the war was over we wouldn't have to go.
2631,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,I will mum
2632,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"Come on, we've got to stay together now. Everything's going to be okay"
2633,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"Bye Mom, we'll miss you"
2634,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Mrs. Macready?
2635,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"No, ma'am. It's just us."
2636,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,The sheets feel scratchy
2637,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,ED!
2638,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Is it Latin?
2639,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,We could play hide-and-seek
2640,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,but we're already having so much fun!
2641,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"Please, please, please."
2642,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,One...two...three...four...
2643,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"Eight four, eighty five..."
2644,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Were you hiding from me?
2645,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,if you don't mind my asking...what are you?
2646,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"I'm not a dwarf, I'm a girl! And actually I'm tallest in my class."
2647,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"Well, my mum's name is Helen..."
2648,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Of course.
2649,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"Well, I came in through the wardrobe in the spare room, and-"
2650,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Narnia? What's that?
2651,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,This is an awfully big wardrobe
2652,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"Glad to meet you, Mr. Tumnus! *extends hand* I'm Lucy Pevensie. Oh, you shake it!"
2653,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,I-I don't know! People do it when they meet each other.
2654,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"Oh! Well, thank you very much! But I probably should be getting back..."
2655,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"Well, maybe for just a little while... if you have... sardines."
2656,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Can I help you with that?
2657,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,He had a nice face. You look just like him.
2658,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,My father is fighting in the war.
2659,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Winter isn't all bad. There's ice skating and snow ball fights. Oh! And Christmas!
2660,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,No presents for a hundred years?
2661,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,yes please
2662,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,": No, I'm afraid I'm not"
2663,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Oh I must go
2664,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,No. You're the nicest faun I've ever met.
2665,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"I'm sure you're very sorry, and you'll never do it again."
2666,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,What are you doing?
2667,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,But I thought you were my friend
2668,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"I think so. Keep it, you need it more than I do."
2669,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"98, 99, 100... Ready or not here I come."
2670,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"I'm back, I'm back, it's alright,"
2671,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"You know, I'm not sure if you two have quite gotten the idea of this game!"
2672,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,but weren't you wondering where I was?
2673,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,I don't think Lucy wants to play anymore.
2674,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"One game at a time Lu, we don't all have your imagination."
2675,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,But I wasn't imagining!
2676,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,You do?
2677,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"Why don't you just stop it, you always have to make everything worse. Grow up!"
2678,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,It was really there...
2679,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Susan's right. That's enough..
2680,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Edmund? Oh Edmund!!!! I saw Mr. Tumnus again and he's fine!!! The White Witch hasn't found out about him helping me!
2681,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"She calls herself the Queen of Narnia, but she really isn't. Edmund? Are you okay? You look awful."
2682,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Come on...this way.
2683,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"Peter, Peter wake up! It's there, it's really there!"
2684,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"Lucy, what are talking about?"
2685,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"Narnia! It's all in the wardrobe, like I told you!"
2686,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"No I wasn't, I saw Mr. Tumnus again! Oh, and this time - Edmund went too."
2687,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,You saw the faun?
2688,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"Well, he didn't actually go there with me. What were you doing Edmund?"
2689,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"We are very sorry sir, it won't happen again."
2690,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,We can handle it!
2691,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"The wardrobe upstairs, Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside."
2692,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,You're-you're not saying you believe her?
2693,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,You....you actually believe her?
2694,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Edmund said they were only pretending
2695,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"No, this would be the first time."
2696,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"Peter winds up, goes for the bowl!"
2697,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream!"
2698,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,I thought you said that it was a kid's game.
2699,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Are you ready then?
2700,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"Well done, Ed!"
2701,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Run!
2702,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Go!
2703,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"Don't worry, it's probably just your imagination"
2704,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,I don't suppose saying we're sorry would quite cover it?
2705,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"No, it wouldn't. But this might!"
2706,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,You little liar!
2707,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Apologize to Lucy.
2708,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Say you're sorry!
2709,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"That's alright, some little children just don't know when to stop pretending."
2710,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,I think Lucy must decide!
2711,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,I all want you to meet Mr. Tumnus!
2712,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Well Mr. Tumnus it is
2713,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,We can use these coats.
2714,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Well I don't think the professor will mind. And if you think about it logically we are not even taking them out of the wardrobe.
2715,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,I know.
2716,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,LUCY!
2717,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Who would do something like this?
2718,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,But we have to help him!
2719,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,It's out of our hands now Lu.
2720,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,You don't get it do you? I'm the human!!! He helped ME!
2721,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Maybe we should call the police
2722,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"Don't worry Lucy, we'll think of something"
2723,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,It's a beaver.
2724,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"Here, boy *clicks* come here...*clicks*"
2725,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Yes?
2726,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,This is the handkerchief I gave to Mr-
2727,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Is he alright?
2728,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,He say's he knows the faun.
2729,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Yes. We were just talking
2730,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,He means the trees.
2731,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"Oh, what a beautiful dam Mr. Beaver."
2732,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,is there nothing we can do about Mr. Tumnus?
2733,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Well we haven't actually been here very long
2734,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,waiting for us?
2735,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,And you think we're the ones???
2736,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,I think you've made a mistake; we're not heroes!
2737,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,I think it's time we were going.
2738,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,But what about Mr. Tumnus?
2739,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Sorry Lucy. It's out of our hands.
2740,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"Ed, time to go- Ed? I'm going to kill him."
2741,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Hurry up!
2742,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Edmund!
2743,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Get off me!
2744,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,We just can't let him go!
2745,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,So you knew this would happen?
2746,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"Stop, this fighting isn't going to help Edmund"
2747,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Then take us to him.
2748,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Only if the Witch has toast.
2749,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,They're in the tunnel!
2750,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,FOX,This is what happens to the enemies of the White Witch.
2751,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,FOX,"Relax, I'm one of the good guys"
2752,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,FOX,"An unfortunate family resemblance, but we can discuss family breeding later right now we need to move."
2753,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,What do you suggest?
2754,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,FOX,"Evening gents, Did we lose something?"
2755,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,FOX,"Humans in Narnia, now that's some valuable information"
2756,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,FOX,"They , they , were heading North."
2757,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,are you all right?
2758,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,FOX,"Well, I wish I could say their bark was worse than their bite."
2759,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,FOX,Well I am afraid that is all the healing I have time for.
2760,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,FOX,It has been a pleasure my Queen. I have been asked by Aslan HIMSELF to gather more troops.
2761,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,FOX,Like everything we have ever heard. He'll be a good help fighting the White Witch
2762,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,FOX,Surely King Peter...
2763,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,We just want to get our brother back.
2764,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,It seems so far
2765,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,If he tells me to Hurry up one more time I'm going to turn him into a big fluffy hat
2766,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,He is getting kinda bossy
2767,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Maybe she's gone.
2768,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,I'll go and have a look
2769,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,AHHH!
2770,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"Merry Christmas, Sir!"
2771,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Presents!
2772,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"Well, I think I could be brave enough."
2773,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Told you he was real!
2774,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Did you hear what he said... winter is almost over. You no what that means... no more ice!
2775,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,We don't have time.
2776,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"No, you're trying to be smart...as usual!"
2777,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Maybe you should.
2778,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Mum's not here!!!
2779,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Oh no!
2780,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Run!!!!!
2781,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,PETER!!!!
2782,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Hold onto me!
2783,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Has anyone seen my coat?
2784,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,FOX,Forgive me your majesty
2785,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,FOX,"Not to seem rude, but I wasn't actually talking to you"
2786,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Maybe they think you look funny.
2787,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,We have come to see Aslan.
2788,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,That's why we are here.
2789,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,He's been captured by the White Witch
2790,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,It is my fault really. I was too hard on him.
2791,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"Sir, he's our brother."
2792,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"No, that's just it...you're not who I think I am"
2793,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,I don't think I will be able.
2794,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Not all of them.
2795,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Maybe we had bring back a whole trunk load when we go home.
2796,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"Yes, before you go boring."
2797,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,EDMUND!
2798,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"Oh, Edmund"
2799,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Get some rest...and Edmund try not to wander off again.
2800,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Narnia isn't going to run out of toast Edmund
2801,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,then you better pack some for the journey
2802,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"You are, I promised I'd keep you three safe but there's no reason I can't stay and help."
2803,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,but they need us...All four of us
2804,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"Lucy it's too dangerous. You almost drowned, Edmund was almost killed!"
2805,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Where are you going?
2806,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"Come on Ed, sword hand up like Oreius showed us."
2807,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Come and take it then.
2808,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Susan!
2809,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,We couldn't sleep
2810,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Why doesn't he fight back?
2811,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,We can't just leave him here.
2812,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,The Trees
2813,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"It is true, he's gone"
2814,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,I can't
2815,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"No, but I bet they help"
2816,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Are you with me?
2817,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"FOR NARNIA, AND FOR ASLAN!!!!"
2818,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,I'm so cold.
2819,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Susan!
2820,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,We have to help them.
2821,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!
2822,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Stop!
2823,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Susan this is...
2824,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,"Ed! There are too many of them! Go! Get out of here! Get the girls, and get them home!"
2825,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Edmund!!
2826,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,When are you ever going to do are you're told?
2827,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,When?
2828,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"No, but he's good..."
2829,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,"What did he say, Susan?"
2830,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,What is this?
2831,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Or a dream of a dream...Spare Oom
2832,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,Not again
2833,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Come on
2834,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,These aren't branches...
2835,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,PETER,You wouldn't believe us if we told you
2836,Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe,LUCY,Will we ever go back?
2837,Coco,MIGUEL,Sometimes I think I'm cursed... 'cause of something that happened before I was even born.
2838,Coco,MIGUEL,"See, a long time ago there was this family."
2839,Coco,MIGUEL,"The papá, he was a musician."
2840,Coco,MIGUEL,"He and his family would sing, and dance, and count their blessings... But he also had a dream... to play for the world. And one day he left with his guitar... and never returned."
2841,Coco,MIGUEL,And the mamá...? She didn't have time to cry over that walkaway musician! After banishing all music from her life...
2842,Coco,MIGUEL,She found a way to provide for her daughter... She rolled up her sleeves and she learned to make shoes. She could have made candy!
2843,Coco,MIGUEL,Or fireworks!
2844,Coco,MIGUEL,Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers!
2845,Coco,MIGUEL,But no... she chose shoes...
2846,Coco,MIGUEL,"Then she taught her daughter to make shoes. And later, she taught her son-in-law."
2847,Coco,MIGUEL,"Then her grandkids got roped in. As her family grew, so did the business."
2848,Coco,MIGUEL,"Music had torn her family apart, but shoes held them all together. You see, that woman was my great- great grandmother, Mamá Imelda."
2849,Coco,MIGUEL,She died WAY before I was born. But my family still tells her story every year on Día de los Muertos -- the Day of the Dead... And her little girl?
2850,Coco,MIGUEL,"She's my great grandmother, Mamá Coco."
2851,Coco,MIGUEL,"Holá, Mamá Coco."
2852,Coco,MIGUEL,"Actually, my name is Miguel. Mamá Coco has trouble remembering things... But it's good to talk to her anyway. So I tell her pretty much everything."
2853,Coco,MIGUEL,I used to run like this...
2854,Coco,MIGUEL,But now I run like this which is way faster!
2855,Coco,MIGUEL,And the winner is... Luchadora Coco!
2856,Coco,MIGUEL,"I have a dimple on this side, but not on this side. Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No dimple--"
2857,Coco,MIGUEL,My Abuelita? She's Mamá Coco's daughter.
2858,Coco,MIGUEL,"No, gracias."
2859,Coco,MIGUEL,S-sí?
2860,Coco,MIGUEL,Abuelita runs our house just like Mamá Imelda did.
2861,Coco,MIGUEL,I think we're the only family in México who hates music...
2862,Coco,MIGUEL,And my family's fine with that...
2863,Coco,MIGUEL,But me?
2864,Coco,MIGUEL,"Love you, Mamá!"
2865,Coco,MIGUEL,I am NOT like the rest of my family...
2866,Coco,MIGUEL,Hola!
2867,Coco,MIGUEL,Muchas gracias!
2868,Coco,MIGUEL,"Hey, hey! Dante!"
2869,Coco,MIGUEL,Sit. Down. Roll over. Shake. Fist bump.
2870,Coco,MIGUEL,"Good boy, Dante!"
2871,Coco,MIGUEL,I know I'm not supposed to love music -- but it's not my fault! It's his: Ernesto de la Cruz...
2872,Coco,MIGUEL,...The greatest musician of all time.
2873,Coco,MIGUEL,"He started out a total nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me. But when he played music, he made people fall in love with him."
2874,Coco,MIGUEL,He starred in movies. He had the coolest guitar... He could fly!
2875,Coco,MIGUEL,And he wrote the best songs! But my all-time favorite? It's--
2876,Coco,MIGUEL,He lived the kind of life you dream about... Until 1942...
2877,Coco,MIGUEL,When he was crushed by a giant bell.
2878,Coco,MIGUEL,I wanna be just like him.
2879,Coco,MIGUEL,"Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and I get this feeling... like we're connected somehow. Like, if HE could play music, maybe someday I could too..."
2880,Coco,MIGUEL,...If it wasn't for my family.
2881,Coco,MIGUEL,Huh?
2882,Coco,MIGUEL,"Oh, yeah, sorry."
2883,Coco,MIGUEL,I just can't really talk about any of this at home so...
2884,Coco,MIGUEL,I could never say that...
2885,Coco,MIGUEL,I don't know. I mean... I only really play for myself--
2886,Coco,MIGUEL,"Uh-uh, my family would freak!"
2887,Coco,MIGUEL,...Seize your moment?
2888,Coco,MIGUEL,Abuelita!
2889,Coco,MIGUEL,Um...uh...
2890,Coco,MIGUEL,He was just showing me his guitar...
2891,Coco,MIGUEL,"Yes, Tío Berto."
2892,Coco,MIGUEL,"No, no, no!"
2893,Coco,MIGUEL,It's just Dante...
2894,Coco,MIGUEL,I was just shining shoes!
2895,Coco,MIGUEL,But the plaza's where all the foot traffic is.
2896,Coco,MIGUEL,But what about tonight?
2897,Coco,MIGUEL,Well they're having this talent show-
2898,Coco,MIGUEL,And I thought I might...
2899,Coco,MIGUEL,"Well, maybe?"
2900,Coco,MIGUEL,I thought we were done...
2901,Coco,MIGUEL,Like Mamá Coco's papá?
2902,Coco,MIGUEL,But you're the one who--
2903,Coco,MIGUEL,I was just--
2904,Coco,MIGUEL,But--
2905,Coco,MIGUEL,I--
2906,Coco,MIGUEL,"Oh, it's you. Get in here, c'mon, Dante. Hurry up."
2907,Coco,MIGUEL,"You're gonna get me in trouble, boy. Someone could hear me!"
2908,Coco,MIGUEL,I wish someone wanted to hear me...
2909,Coco,MIGUEL,Other than you...
2910,Coco,MIGUEL,Perfecto!
2911,Coco,MIGUEL,...and make it come true.
2912,Coco,MIGUEL,"No more hiding, Dante. I gotta seize my moment!"
2913,Coco,MIGUEL,I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza if it kills me!
2914,Coco,MIGUEL,"Get under, get under!"
2915,Coco,MIGUEL,Nothing!
2916,Coco,MIGUEL,"Mamá -- Papá, I--"
2917,Coco,MIGUEL,What?!
2918,Coco,MIGUEL,But what if I'm no good at making shoes?
2919,Coco,MIGUEL,...A shoemaker. Through and through.
2920,Coco,MIGUEL,"Dante! No, Dante, stop!"
2921,Coco,MIGUEL,"No, no, no, no, no! No..."
2922,Coco,MIGUEL,De la Cruz's guitar...?
2923,Coco,MIGUEL,"Mamá Coco, is your papá... Ernesto de la Cruz?"
2924,Coco,MIGUEL,"Ha, ha!"
2925,Coco,MIGUEL,Papá! Papá!
2926,Coco,MIGUEL,It's him! I know who my great- great grandfather was!
2927,Coco,MIGUEL,Mamá Coco's father was Ernesto de la Cruz!
2928,Coco,MIGUEL,I'm gonna be a musician!
2929,Coco,MIGUEL,It's not a fantasy!
2930,Coco,MIGUEL,That man was Ernesto de la Cruz! The greatest musician of all time!
2931,Coco,MIGUEL,"But Papá, you said my family would guide me! Well de la Cruz IS my family! I'm supposed to play music!"
2932,Coco,MIGUEL,If you would just let--
2933,Coco,MIGUEL,Just listen to me play--
2934,Coco,MIGUEL,I don't care if I'm on some stupid ofrenda!
2935,Coco,MIGUEL,No!
2936,Coco,MIGUEL,I don't wanna be in this family!
2937,Coco,MIGUEL,I wanna play in the plaza. Like de la Cruz! Can I still sign-up?
2938,Coco,MIGUEL,No... But if I can borrow a guitar--
2939,Coco,MIGUEL,"Excuse me, can I borrow your guitar?"
2940,Coco,MIGUEL,You guys have a spare guitar?
2941,Coco,MIGUEL,"I need a guitar, just for a little bit--"
2942,Coco,MIGUEL,Great-great grandfather... What am I supposed to do?
2943,Coco,MIGUEL,"No, no, no, no, no, Dante stop! Cállate! Shhh!"
2944,Coco,MIGUEL,I'm sorry...
2945,Coco,MIGUEL,"Señor de la Cruz? Please don't be mad. I'm Miguel, your great-great grandson... I need to borrow this."
2946,Coco,MIGUEL,"Our family thinks music is a curse. None of them understand, but I know you would have. You would've told me to follow my heart. To seize my moment!"
2947,Coco,MIGUEL,"So if it's all right with you, I'm gonna play in the plaza, just like you did!"
2948,Coco,MIGUEL,I... I'm sorry! It's not what it looks like! De la Cruz is my...
2949,Coco,MIGUEL,Mamá!
2950,Coco,MIGUEL,"Thanks, I--"
2951,Coco,MIGUEL,Ahhh!
2952,Coco,MIGUEL,AHHH!
2953,Coco,MIGUEL,Dante?! You can see me? W-wait! What's going on?!
2954,Coco,MIGUEL,Dante! Dante!
2955,Coco,MIGUEL,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
2956,Coco,MIGUEL,Remind me how I know you?
2957,Coco,MIGUEL,Tía... Rosita?
2958,Coco,MIGUEL,Papá Julio?
2959,Coco,MIGUEL,Tía Victoria?
2960,Coco,MIGUEL,Tío Oscar? Tío Felipe?
2961,Coco,MIGUEL,Whoa...
2962,Coco,MIGUEL,"Dante! Dante! Dante, wait up!"
2963,Coco,MIGUEL,"You gotta stay with me, boy. We don't know... where..."
2964,Coco,MIGUEL,"This isn't a dream, then. You're all really out there..."
2965,Coco,MIGUEL,"Well I don't know, I thought it might've been one of those made up things that adults tell kids... like... vitamins."
2966,Coco,MIGUEL,"Well, now I'm thinking maybe they could be..."
2967,Coco,MIGUEL,Are those...? Alebrijes! But those are--
2968,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo. Shall we skip the scanner? I'm on so many ofrendas, it'll just overwhelm your blinky thingie..."
2969,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Okay, when I said I was Frida... just now? That... that was a lie. And I apologize for doing that."
2970,Coco,HÉCTOR,"You know what, I'm just gonna zip right over, you won't even know I'm gone."
2971,Coco,HÉCTOR,Ha HA!
2972,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Almost there, just a little further...!"
2973,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Fine, okay. Fine, who cares... Dumb flower bridge!"
2974,Coco,MIGUEL,Hola.
2975,Coco,MIGUEL,Whoa...
2976,Coco,MIGUEL,Mamá Imelda...
2977,Coco,MIGUEL,What?!
2978,Coco,MIGUEL,But I wasn't stealing the guitar!
2979,Coco,MIGUEL,"It was my great-great grandfather's, he would have wanted me to have it--"
2980,Coco,MIGUEL,"Uh, you're all dead."
2981,Coco,MIGUEL,That's just Dante.
2982,Coco,MIGUEL,But Dante doesn't have any hair.
2983,Coco,MIGUEL,Oh...
2984,Coco,MIGUEL,It was an accident!
2985,Coco,MIGUEL,That's it?
2986,Coco,MIGUEL,What happens at sunrise?
2987,Coco,MIGUEL,What? She can't do that!
2988,Coco,MIGUEL,Fine.
2989,Coco,MIGUEL,No skeletons!
2990,Coco,MIGUEL,"Mariachi Plaza, here I come--"
2991,Coco,MIGUEL,"This isn't fair, it's my life! You already had yours!"
2992,Coco,MIGUEL,"Papá Julio, I ask for your blessing."
2993,Coco,MIGUEL,Tía Rosita? Oscar? Felipe? Tía Victoria?
2994,Coco,MIGUEL,You really hate music that much?
2995,Coco,MIGUEL,The same path he did.
2996,Coco,MIGUEL,He's family...
2997,Coco,MIGUEL,"Con permiso, I... need to visit the restroom. Be right back!"
2998,Coco,MIGUEL,Vámonos.
2999,Coco,MIGUEL,"If I wanna be a musician, I need a MUSICIAN'S blessing. We gotta find my great-great grandpa."
3000,Coco,MIGUEL,"No, no -- Dante!"
3001,Coco,HÉCTOR,That's illegal?
3002,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Amigo? Oh, that's so nice, to hear you say that, because... I've just had a really hard Día de Muertos, and I could really use an amigo right now."
3003,Coco,HÉCTOR,"And amigos, they help their amigos. Listen, you get me across that bridge tonight and I'll make it worth your while."
3004,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Oh, you like de la Cruz? He and I go way back! I can get you front row seats to his Sunrise Spectacular Show!"
3005,Coco,HÉCTOR,"I'll -- I'll get you backstage, you can meet him! You just gotta let me cross that bridge!"
3006,Coco,HÉCTOR,Can I at least get my costume back?
3007,Coco,HÉCTOR,Some amigo...
3008,Coco,MIGUEL,Hey. Hey! You really know de la Cruz?
3009,Coco,HÉCTOR,Who wants to-- Ah! You're alive!
3010,Coco,MIGUEL,Shhh!
3011,Coco,MIGUEL,"Yeah I'm alive. And if I wanna get back to the Land of the Living, I need de la Cruz's blessing."
3012,Coco,HÉCTOR,That's weirdly specific.
3013,Coco,MIGUEL,He's my great-great-grandfather.
3014,Coco,HÉCTOR,He's your wha-whaat...?
3015,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait... Wait, no, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait? Yes! You're going back to the Land of the Living?!"
3016,Coco,MIGUEL,"D'ya know what, maybe this isn't such a g--"
3017,Coco,HÉCTOR,"No, niño, niño, niño, I can help you! You can help me. We can help each other! But most importantly, you can help ME."
3018,Coco,MIGUEL,AH!
3019,Coco,HÉCTOR,I'm Héctor.
3020,Coco,MIGUEL,That's nice!
3021,Coco,HÉCTOR,Espérame chamaco!
3022,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Hey, hey, hold still. Look up. Look up. A ver, a ver... look up. Up, UP!... Ta-da!"
3023,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Dead as a doorknob. So listen, Miguel: this place runs on memories. When you're well- remembered, people put up your photo and you get to cross the bridge and visit the living on Día de Muertos. Unless you're me."
3024,Coco,MIGUEL,You don't get to cross over.
3025,Coco,HÉCTOR,No one's ever put up my picture... But you can change that!
3026,Coco,MIGUEL,This is you?
3027,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Muy guapo, eh?"
3028,Coco,MIGUEL,"So you get me to my great-great grandpa, then I put up your photo when I get home?"
3029,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Such a smart boy! Yes! Great idea, yes! One hiccup: de la Cruz is a tough guy to get to. And I need to cross that bridge soon. Like TONIGHT. So, you got any other family here, you know? Someone a bit more... accessible?"
3030,Coco,MIGUEL,"Mmm, nope."
3031,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Don't yank my chain, chamaco. You gotta have SOME other family."
3032,Coco,MIGUEL,"ONLY de la Cruz. If you can't help me, I'll find him myself."
3033,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Okay, okay, kid, fine -- fine! I'll get you to your great-great grandpa...!"
3034,Coco,HÉCTOR,"...It's not gonna be easy, you know? He's a busy man. What are you doing?"
3035,Coco,MIGUEL,I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in.
3036,Coco,HÉCTOR,"No, skeletons don't walk like that."
3037,Coco,MIGUEL,It's how you walk.
3038,Coco,HÉCTOR,"No, I don't."
3039,Coco,HÉCTOR,Stop it!
3040,Coco,MIGUEL,"Whoa...""Ernesto de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular...!"" Qué padre!"
3041,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Blech. Every year, your great- great grandpa puts on that dumb show to mark the end of Día de Muertos."
3042,Coco,MIGUEL,And you can get us in!
3043,Coco,HÉCTOR,Ahhhh--
3044,Coco,MIGUEL,"Hey, you said you had front row tickets!"
3045,Coco,HÉCTOR,That... that was a lie. I apologize for that.
3046,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Cool off, chamaco, come on... I'll get you to him."
3047,Coco,MIGUEL,How?
3048,Coco,HÉCTOR,'Cause I happen to know where he's rehearsing!
3049,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Hola, Ceci!"
3050,Coco,MIGUEL,Hola.
3051,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Ceci, I lost the dress--"
3052,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Ceci -- I know, Ceci. I know, I know. Ceci -- Ceci... Ceci. Ceci..."
3053,Coco,MIGUEL,Dante... Dante!
3054,Coco,MIGUEL,We shouldn't be in here...
3055,Coco,MIGUEL,"No, no, Dante! Ven acá!"
3056,Coco,MIGUEL,I just followed my--
3057,Coco,MIGUEL,I don't think he's a spirit guide.
3058,Coco,MIGUEL,"I think it's just the right amount of obvious? It could use some music... Oh! What if you did, like, doonk-doonk- doonk-doonk..."
3059,Coco,MIGUEL,Oh! And then it could go dittle- ittle-dittle-ittle-dittle-ittle- dittle-ittle -- WHAAA!
3060,Coco,MIGUEL,Huh?
3061,Coco,MIGUEL,"Excuse me, where's the real de la Cruz?"
3062,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Chamaco! You can't run off on me like that! C'mon, stop pestering the celebrities..."
3063,Coco,MIGUEL,"You said my great-great grandpa would be here! He's halfway across town, throwing some big party."
3064,Coco,HÉCTOR,That bum! Who doesn't show up to his own rehearsal?
3065,Coco,MIGUEL,"If you're such good friends, how come he didn't invite you?"
3066,Coco,HÉCTOR,He's YOUR great-great grandpa. How come he didn't invite YOU?
3067,Coco,HÉCTOR,Hey Gustavo! You know anything about this party?
3068,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Ha ha, very funny guys. Very funny."
3069,Coco,MIGUEL,Chorizo?
3070,Coco,HÉCTOR,I don't want to talk about it.
3071,Coco,HÉCTOR,"I didn't choke, okay -- I got food poisoning, which is a big difference!"
3072,Coco,HÉCTOR,This is why I don't like musicians... bunch of self- important jerks!
3073,Coco,MIGUEL,"Hey, I'm a musician."
3074,Coco,HÉCTOR,You are?
3075,Coco,HÉCTOR,"No, no, no, chamaco, you are loco if you think--"
3076,Coco,MIGUEL,I need to get my great-great grandfather's blessing.
3077,Coco,MIGUEL,You know where I can get a guitar?
3078,Coco,HÉCTOR,I know a guy...
3079,Coco,HÉCTOR,Why the heck would you wanna be a musician?
3080,Coco,MIGUEL,My great-great grandpa was a musician.
3081,Coco,HÉCTOR,"...Who spent his life performing like a monkey for complete strangers. Blech, no, no thank you, guácala, no..."
3082,Coco,MIGUEL,Whadda you know?
3083,Coco,MIGUEL,"So, how far is this guitar anyway?"
3084,Coco,HÉCTOR,We're almost there...
3085,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Keep up, chamaco, come on!"
3086,Coco,HÉCTOR,Eh! These guys!
3087,Coco,HÉCTOR,Hey Tío! Qué onda!
3088,Coco,MIGUEL,These people are all your family?
3089,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Eh, in a way... We're all the ones with no photos or ofrendas, no family to go home to. Nearly forgotten, you know? So, we all call each other cousin, or tío, or whatever."
3090,Coco,HÉCTOR,Tía Chelo! He-hey!
3091,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Hey, hey! Save some for me! Is Chicharrón around?"
3092,Coco,HÉCTOR,Who doesn't like a visit from Cousin Héctor?
3093,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Buenas noches, Chicharrón!"
3094,Coco,HÉCTOR,"C'mon, it's Día de Muertos! I brought you a little offering!"
3095,Coco,HÉCTOR,"I would, Cheech, but the thing is... me and my friend, Miguel, we really need to borrow your guitar."
3096,Coco,HÉCTOR,Yes?
3097,Coco,HÉCTOR,I promise we'll bring it right back.
3098,Coco,HÉCTOR,Uh...
3099,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Ah, you see­-"
3100,Coco,HÉCTOR,"No, no, not like those times."
3101,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Whoa, whoa -- you okay, amigo?"
3102,Coco,HÉCTOR,"You know I don't play anymore, Cheech. The guitar's for the kid--"
3103,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Only for you, amigo. Any requests?"
3104,Coco,HÉCTOR,...KNUCKLES THEY DRAG ON THE FLOOR.
3105,Coco,HÉCTOR,"There are children present. HER HAIR IS LIKE A BRIAR, SHE STANDS IN A BOW-LEGGED STANCE. AND IF I WEREN'T SO UGLY, SHE'D POSSIBLY GIVE ME A CHANCE!"
3106,Coco,MIGUEL,Wait... what happened?
3107,Coco,HÉCTOR,"He's been forgotten. When there's no one left in the living world who remembers you, you disappear from this world. We call it the ""Final Death."""
3108,Coco,MIGUEL,Where did he go?
3109,Coco,HÉCTOR,No one knows.
3110,Coco,MIGUEL,"But I've met him... I could remember him, when I go back..."
3111,Coco,HÉCTOR,"No, it doesn't work like that, chamaco. Our memories... they have to be passed down by those who knew us in life -- in the stories they tell about us. But there's no one left alive to pass down Cheech's stories..."
3112,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Hey, it happens to everyone eventually."
3113,Coco,HÉCTOR,"C'mon ""de la Cruzcito."" You've got a contest to win."
3114,Coco,MIGUEL,"You told me you hated musicians, you never said you were one."
3115,Coco,HÉCTOR,How do you think I knew your great- great grandpa? We used to play music together. Taught him everything he knows.
3116,Coco,MIGUEL,"No manches! You played with Ernesto de la Cruz, the greatest musician of all time?"
3117,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Ha-ha, you're funny! Greatest eyebrows of all time maybe but his music, eh, not so much."
3118,Coco,MIGUEL,You don't know what you're talking about...
3119,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz! Showtime, chamaco!"
3120,Coco,HÉCTOR,"That's our ticket, muchacho."
3121,Coco,HÉCTOR,So what's the plan? What are you gonna play?
3122,Coco,MIGUEL,"Definitely ""Remember Me."""
3123,Coco,HÉCTOR,"No, not that one. No."
3124,Coco,MIGUEL,"C'mon, it's his most popular song!"
3125,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Ehck, it's too popular."
3126,Coco,MIGUEL,"Um... what about ""Poco Loco?"""
3127,Coco,HÉCTOR,Epa! Now that's a song!
3128,Coco,HÉCTOR,You always this nervous before a performance?
3129,Coco,MIGUEL,I don't know -- I've never performed before.
3130,Coco,HÉCTOR,What?! You said you were a musician!
3131,Coco,MIGUEL,I am! I mean I will be. Once I win.
3132,Coco,HÉCTOR,"That's your plan?! No, no, no, no, no, you have to win, Miguel. Your life LITERALLY depends on you winning! AND YOU'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE?!"
3133,Coco,HÉCTOR,I'll go up there--
3134,Coco,MIGUEL,No! I need to do this.
3135,Coco,HÉCTOR,Why?
3136,Coco,MIGUEL,If I can't go out there and play one song... how can I call myself a musician?
3137,Coco,HÉCTOR,What does that matter?!
3138,Coco,MIGUEL,'Cuz I don't just want to get de la Cruz's blessing. I need to prove that... that I'm worthy of it.
3139,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Oh. Oh, that's such a sweet sentiment... at SUCH a bad time!"
3140,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Okay... okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay you wanna perform? Then you've got to PERFORM!"
3141,Coco,HÉCTOR,"First you have to loosen up. Shake off those nerves! Sáquenlo sáquenlo, sáquenlo!"
3142,Coco,HÉCTOR,Now gimme your best grito!
3143,Coco,MIGUEL,My best grito?
3144,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Come on, yell! Belt it out! OOOOOOH HE-HE-HEY! Ha! Ah, feels good! Okay... now you."
3145,Coco,MIGUEL,Ah -- ah -- ayyyyy yaaaaayyyyay...
3146,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Oh, c'mon kid..."
3147,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Miguel, look at me."
3148,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Hey! Hey, look at me."
3149,Coco,HÉCTOR,You can do this. Grab their attention and don't let it go!
3150,Coco,MIGUEL,Héctor...
3151,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Make 'em listen, chamaco! You got this!"
3152,Coco,HÉCTOR,Arre papá! Hey!
3153,Coco,HÉCTOR,What's he doing? Why isn't he playing?
3154,Coco,MIGUEL,HAAAAAAAI-YAAAAAAAAAAAI-YAAAAAAAAI!
3155,Coco,MIGUEL,"WHAT COLOR IS THE SKY? AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR YOU TELL ME THAT IT'S RED AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR WHERE SHOULD I PUT MY SHOES? AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR YOU SAY PUT THEM ON YOUR HEAD AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR"
3156,Coco,MIGUEL,YOU MAKE ME UN POCO LOCO
3157,Coco,HÉCTOR,"No, no, no, no..."
3158,Coco,MIGUEL,Not bad for a dead guy!
3159,Coco,HÉCTOR,"You're not so bad yourself, gordito! Eso!"
3160,Coco,HÉCTOR,THE LOCO THAT YOU MAKE ME IT IS JUST UN POCO CRAZY THE SENSE THAT YOU'RE NOT MAKING...
3161,Coco,MIGUEL,THE LIBERTIES YOU'RE TAKING...
3162,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Hey, you did good! I'm proud of you! Eso!"
3163,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Hey, where are you going?"
3164,Coco,MIGUEL,We gotta get outta here.
3165,Coco,HÉCTOR,"What, are you crazy? We're about to win this thing!"
3166,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Wait, wait, wait! You said de la Cruz was your ONLY family. The ONLY person who could send you home."
3167,Coco,MIGUEL,"I do have other family, but--"
3168,Coco,HÉCTOR,You could have taken my photo back this whole time?!
3169,Coco,MIGUEL,--But they hate music! I need a musician's blessing!
3170,Coco,HÉCTOR,You lied to me!
3171,Coco,MIGUEL,"Oh, you're one to talk!"
3172,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Look at me. I'm being forgotten, Miguel. I don't even know if I'm gonna last the night! I'm not gonna miss my one chance to cross that bridge 'cause you want to live out some stupid musical fantasy!"
3173,Coco,MIGUEL,It's not stupid.
3174,Coco,HÉCTOR,I'm taking you to your family.
3175,Coco,MIGUEL,Let go of me!
3176,Coco,HÉCTOR,You'll thank me later--
3177,Coco,MIGUEL,"You don't wanna help me, you only care about yourself! Keep your dumb photo!"
3178,Coco,HÉCTOR,"No -- no, no, no! No..."
3179,Coco,MIGUEL,Stay away from me!
3180,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Hey, chamaco! Where did you go?! Chamaco! I'm sorry! Come back!"
3181,Coco,MIGUEL,"Dante, cállate!"
3182,Coco,MIGUEL,"No, Dante! Stop it! He can't help me!"
3183,Coco,MIGUEL,"Dante, stop! Stop it! Leave me alone! You're not a spirit guide, you're just a dumb dog! Now get out of here!"
3184,Coco,MIGUEL,AAHH!
3185,Coco,MIGUEL,I don't want your blessing!
3186,Coco,MIGUEL,You're ruining my life!
3187,Coco,MIGUEL,"Music's the only thing that makes me happy. And you, you wanna take that away! You'll never understand."
3188,Coco,MIGUEL,I thought you hated music.
3189,Coco,MIGUEL,But I don't wanna... pick sides! Why can't you be on MY side? That's what family's supposed to do -- support you. But you never will.
3190,Coco,MIGUEL,It's okay. I'm Ernesto's great- great grandson!
3191,Coco,MIGUEL,"Disculpen, señores..."
3192,Coco,MIGUEL,"You too! Hey, musician to musician, I need a favor..."
3193,Coco,MIGUEL,Thanks guys!
3194,Coco,MIGUEL,Whoa...
3195,Coco,MIGUEL,Gracias!
3196,Coco,MIGUEL,De la Cruz...
3197,Coco,MIGUEL,Señor de la Cruz!
3198,Coco,MIGUEL,"Pardon me, Señor de la Cruz! Señor de la--"
3199,Coco,MIGUEL,Señor de la Cruz! Señor de la--
3200,Coco,MIGUEL,FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANGUAGE AND THE WORLD ES MI FAMILIA
3201,Coco,MIGUEL,FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANG--
3202,Coco,MIGUEL,You... know about me?
3203,Coco,MIGUEL,I'm Miguel. Your great-great grandson.
3204,Coco,MIGUEL,"I need your blessing. So I can go back home and be a musician, just like you."
3205,Coco,MIGUEL,"The rest of our family, they wouldn't listen. But I... I hoped you would?"
3206,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo."
3207,Coco,HÉCTOR,Gracias...
3208,Coco,MIGUEL,Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No dimple.
3209,Coco,MIGUEL,No -- it's all great.
3210,Coco,MIGUEL,It's just -- I've been looking up to you my whole life. You're the guy who actually did it! But... Did you ever regret it? Choosing music over... everything else.
3211,Coco,MIGUEL,Leaving your family?
3212,Coco,MIGUEL,You mean it?!
3213,Coco,MIGUEL,I can't... I have to get home before sunrise.
3214,Coco,HÉCTOR,"We had a deal, chamaco!"
3215,Coco,HÉCTOR,"You said you'd take back my photo. You promised, Miguel."
3216,Coco,MIGUEL,I just met him tonight. He told me he knew you--
3217,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Please Miguel, put my photo up."
3218,Coco,HÉCTOR,And whose fault is that?
3219,Coco,HÉCTOR,Those were MY songs you took. MY songs that made YOU famous.
3220,Coco,MIGUEL,W-What?
3221,Coco,HÉCTOR,"If I'm being forgotten, it's because you never told anyone that I wrote them--"
3222,Coco,MIGUEL,"That's crazy, de la Cruz wrote all his own songs."
3223,Coco,HÉCTOR,"You wanna tell him, or should I?"
3224,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Oh, how generous."
3225,Coco,MIGUEL,You really did play together...
3226,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Look, I don't want to fight about it. I just want you to make it right. Miguel can put my photo up--"
3227,Coco,HÉCTOR,--And I can cross over the bridge. I can see my girl.
3228,Coco,HÉCTOR,Ernesto... Remember the night I left?
3229,Coco,HÉCTOR,"We drank together and you told me you would move heaven and earth for your amigo. Well, I'm asking you to now."
3230,Coco,MIGUEL,Heaven and earth? Like in the movie?
3231,Coco,HÉCTOR,What?
3232,Coco,MIGUEL,"That's Don Hidalgo's toast... in the de la Cruz movie, ""El Camino A Casa."""
3233,Coco,HÉCTOR,"I'm talking about my real life, Miguel."
3234,Coco,MIGUEL,"No, it's in there. Look."
3235,Coco,MIGUEL,"But in the movie, Don Hidalgo poisons the drink..."
3236,Coco,HÉCTOR,"That night, Ernesto. The night I left..."
3237,Coco,HÉCTOR,We'd been performing on the road for months. I got homesick -- and I packed up my songs...
3238,Coco,HÉCTOR,This was your dream. You'll manage.
3239,Coco,HÉCTOR,"I'm going home, Ernesto. Hate me if you want, but my mind is made up."
3240,Coco,HÉCTOR,You walked me to the train station.
3241,Coco,HÉCTOR,But I felt a pain in my stomach. I thought it must have been something I ate...
3242,Coco,HÉCTOR,Or something I... drank.
3243,Coco,HÉCTOR,I woke up dead.
3244,Coco,HÉCTOR,You... POISONED me.
3245,Coco,HÉCTOR,All this time I thought it was just bad luck.
3246,Coco,HÉCTOR,I never thought that you might have... that you...
3247,Coco,HÉCTOR,How could you?!
3248,Coco,MIGUEL,Héctor!
3249,Coco,HÉCTOR,You took everything away from me!
3250,Coco,HÉCTOR,You rat!
3251,Coco,HÉCTOR,"I just wanted to go back home! No, no, NO!"
3252,Coco,MIGUEL,You were going to give me your blessing...
3253,Coco,MIGUEL,That you murdered Héctor... for his songs?
3254,Coco,MIGUEL,I -- no! Everyone knows you're the... the good guy.
3255,Coco,MIGUEL,Papá Ernesto? My blessing?
3256,Coco,MIGUEL,What?! But I'm your family!
3257,Coco,MIGUEL,"No, NO!"
3258,Coco,MIGUEL,Let go!
3259,Coco,MIGUEL,NO! AHHHHHH!
3260,Coco,MIGUEL,Help! Can anyone hear me? I wanna go home!
3261,Coco,MIGUEL,Héctor?
3262,Coco,HÉCTOR,Kid?
3263,Coco,MIGUEL,"Oh, Héctor!"
3264,Coco,MIGUEL,You were right. I should have gone back to my family--
3265,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Hey -- hey, hey..."
3266,Coco,MIGUEL,"They told me not to be like de la Cruz, but I didn't listen--"
3267,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Hey, it's okay..."
3268,Coco,MIGUEL,I told them I didn't care if they remembered me. I didn't care if I was on their stupid ofrenda.
3269,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Hey, chamaco, it's okay. It's okay."
3270,Coco,MIGUEL,I told them I didn't care.
3271,Coco,HÉCTOR,Hhuuh!
3272,Coco,MIGUEL,Héctor! Héctor--
3273,Coco,HÉCTOR,She's... forgetting me.
3274,Coco,MIGUEL,Who?
3275,Coco,HÉCTOR,My daughter...
3276,Coco,MIGUEL,She's the reason you wanted to cross the bridge...
3277,Coco,HÉCTOR,I just wanted to see her again... I never should have left Santa Cecilia. I wish I could apologize. I wish I could tell her that her papá was trying to come home. That he loved her so much. My Coco...
3278,Coco,MIGUEL,Coco?
3279,Coco,HÉCTOR,Where... where did you get this?
3280,Coco,MIGUEL,That's my Mamá Coco. That's my Mamá Imelda. Is that... you?
3281,Coco,HÉCTOR,We're...
3282,Coco,HÉCTOR,I always hoped I'd see her again. That she'd miss me... maybe put up my photo. But it never happened. You know the worst part? Even if I never got to see Coco in the living world... I thought at least one day I'd see her here. Give her the biggest hug... But she's the last person who remembers me. The moment she's gone from the living world...
3283,Coco,MIGUEL,You disappear... from this one. You'll never get to see her...
3284,Coco,HÉCTOR,...Ever again.
3285,Coco,HÉCTOR,"You know, I wrote her a song once. We used to sing it every night at the same time, no matter how far apart we were. What I wouldn't give to sing it to her... one last time."
3286,Coco,HÉCTOR,THOUGH I HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR
3287,Coco,MIGUEL,He stole your guitar... He stole your songs...
3288,Coco,MIGUEL,"You should be the one the world remembers, not de la Cruz!"
3289,Coco,HÉCTOR,"I didn't write ""Remember Me"" for the world... I wrote it for Coco. I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a great-great grandpa."
3290,Coco,MIGUEL,Are you kidding? A minute ago I thought I was related to a murderer. You're a total upgrade!
3291,Coco,MIGUEL,"My whole life, there's been something that made me different... and I never knew where it came from. But now I know. It comes from you. I'm proud we're family!"
3292,Coco,MIGUEL,I'm proud to be his family! TRRRRRAI-HAY-HAY-HAY-HAAAY!
3293,Coco,MIGUEL,Dante?
3294,Coco,MIGUEL,Dante! It's Dante!
3295,Coco,HÉCTOR,Imelda!
3296,Coco,HÉCTOR,You look good...
3297,Coco,MIGUEL,"Dante, you knew he was my Papá Héctor the whole time! You ARE a real spirit guide! Who's a good spirit guide? You are!"
3298,Coco,MIGUEL,Whoa...
3299,Coco,MIGUEL,Dante!
3300,Coco,HÉCTOR,Imelda--
3301,Coco,MIGUEL,"I wasn't in there `cause of Héctor. He was in there `cause of me. He was just trying to get me home... I didn't wanna listen, but he was right... nothing is more important than family."
3302,Coco,MIGUEL,"I'm ready to accept your blessing... and your conditions. But first, I need to find de la Cruz. To get Héctor's photo."
3303,Coco,MIGUEL,So he can see Coco again. Héctor should be on our ofrenda. He's part of our family--
3304,Coco,MIGUEL,He tried to go home to you and Coco... but de la Cruz murdered him!
3305,Coco,HÉCTOR,"It's true, Imelda."
3306,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Imelda, I--"
3307,Coco,MIGUEL,Héctor?
3308,Coco,HÉCTOR,I'm running out of time. It's Coco...
3309,Coco,MIGUEL,You don't have to forgive him... But we shouldn't forget him.
3310,Coco,HÉCTOR,"This is my fault, not yours. I'm sorry, Imelda."
3311,Coco,MIGUEL,Family comes first.
3312,Coco,MIGUEL,I might know a way...
3313,Coco,MIGUEL,Gracias Frida!
3314,Coco,MIGUEL,Ow!
3315,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Here, let me help you with--"
3316,Coco,MIGUEL,Everyone clear on the plan?
3317,Coco,HÉCTOR,Got your petals?
3318,Coco,HÉCTOR,She's talking about me! I'm the love of your life?
3319,Coco,MIGUEL,She's talking about me!
3320,Coco,MIGUEL,The photo!
3321,Coco,HÉCTOR,"You said ""love of your life..."""
3322,Coco,MIGUEL,That's what I heard...
3323,Coco,MIGUEL,"Hurry, come on!"
3324,Coco,MIGUEL,Sing!
3325,Coco,MIGUEL,SING!
3326,Coco,HÉCTOR,You... still got it.
3327,Coco,MIGUEL,Ahem.
3328,Coco,MIGUEL,Never play music again...
3329,Coco,HÉCTOR,You're going home.
3330,Coco,HÉCTOR,Imelda--
3331,Coco,MIGUEL,Dante!
3332,Coco,HÉCTOR,"Ernesto, stop! Leave the boy alone!"
3333,Coco,HÉCTOR,"He's a living child, Ernesto!"
3334,Coco,MIGUEL,You're a coward!
3335,Coco,MIGUEL,"Héctor's the real musician, you're just the guy who murdered him and stole his songs!"
3336,Coco,MIGUEL,AHHH!
3337,Coco,HÉCTOR,NO!
3338,Coco,MIGUEL,"Good boy, Dante."
3339,Coco,MIGUEL,"Héctor! The photo, I lost it..."
3340,Coco,HÉCTOR,"It's okay, mijo. It's--"
3341,Coco,MIGUEL,Héctor! Héctor?!
3342,Coco,HÉCTOR,Coco...
3343,Coco,MIGUEL,No! We can still find the photo...
3344,Coco,MIGUEL,"No, no, no, I can't leave you. I promised I'd put your photo up. I promised you'd see Coco!"
3345,Coco,HÉCTOR,"We're both out of time, mijo."
3346,Coco,MIGUEL,"No, no... she can't forget you!"
3347,Coco,HÉCTOR,I just wanted her to know that I loved her.
3348,Coco,MIGUEL,Héctor--
3349,Coco,HÉCTOR,"You have our blessing, Miguel."
3350,Coco,MIGUEL,"No, Papá Héctor, please!"
3351,Coco,MIGUEL,No...
3352,Coco,HÉCTOR,Go home...
3353,Coco,MIGUEL,I promise I won't let Coco forget you! Aaahh!--
3354,Coco,MIGUEL,"Ah! I need to see Mamá Coco, please--"
3355,Coco,MIGUEL,Mamá Coco? Can you hear me? It's Miguel.
3356,Coco,MIGUEL,"I saw your papá. Remember? Papá? Please -- if you forget him, he'll be gone... forever!"
3357,Coco,MIGUEL,"Here -- this was his guitar, right? He used to play it to you? See, there he is."
3358,Coco,MIGUEL,"Papá, remember? Papá?"
3359,Coco,MIGUEL,"Mamá Coco, please, don't forget him."
3360,Coco,MIGUEL,"I'm sorry, Papá."
3361,Coco,MIGUEL,Not all of us...
3362,Coco,MIGUEL,Mamá Coco...
3363,Coco,MIGUEL,Mamá Coco? Your papá -- he wanted you to have this.
3364,Coco,MIGUEL,"FOR EVEN IF I'M FAR AWAY, I HOLD YOU IN MY HEART I SING A SECRET SONG TO YOU EACH NIGHT WE ARE APART"
3365,Coco,MIGUEL,"He loved you, Mamá Coco. Your papá loved you so much."
3366,Coco,MIGUEL,And that man is your Papá Julio...
3367,Coco,MIGUEL,...And there's Tía Rosita... and your Tía Victoria... and those two are Oscar and Felipe. These aren't just old pictures -- they're our family -- and they're counting on us to remember them.
3368,Coco,MIGUEL,BUT LAST NIGHT IT SEEMED THAT I DREAMED ABOUT YOU
3369,Coco,HÉCTOR,Coco!
3370,Coco,MIGUEL,WHEN I OPENED MY MOUTH WHAT CAME OUT WAS A SONG AND YOU KNEW EVERY WORD AND WE ALL SANG ALONG
3371,Coco,MIGUEL,OUR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER
3372,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Is that what they say about me?
3373,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me of the one that belonged to my mother. It can't be the same one - her pearls are in this safe - He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the bureau, revealing a safe door... - which the manufacturer clearly explained is uncrackable."
3374,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I'm afraid I can't let you take those.
3375,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,She's very persistent.
3376,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I wasn't.
3377,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Examining print dust. We've been robbed.
3378,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"One of the maids, perhaps you should stop letting them in this side of the house."
3379,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I'm not. She was.
3380,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Just trying to find out more about our jewel thief. I ran her prints from the photos she handled - Wayne pulls up a mug shot - a fat, male armed-robbery suspect. - but she was wearing someone else's fingerprints. She's good."
3381,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"We do, so I cross-referenced the address she went back to with police data on high-end B-and-E's..."
3382,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"She's good, but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet."
3383,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,She won't. She likes them too much. And they weren't what she was after.
3384,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"My fingerprints. There was printer toner mixed with graphite on the safe. Gives you a good pull, and it's untraceable."
3385,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Now you're trying to set me up with a jewel thief?
3386,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,There's nothing out there for me.
3387,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"What can I do for you, officer?"
3388,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I'm sorry to hear that -
3389,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Shouldn't you be telling this to your superior officers?
3390,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,If Commissioner Gordon thinks I'm the Batman he must be in a bad way
3391,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Why did you say your boys' home used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation?
3392,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,You checked that name? 'Bane' -
3393,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Now Daggett's brought them here?
3394,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Why did the Wayne Foundation stop funding boys' homes in the city?
3395,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think."
3396,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,No. Do we still have any cars around the place?
3397,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,And I need an appointment at the hospital. About my leg.
3398,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.
3399,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,I'll pass along your request. Next time I see him. Miranda catches something in this.
3400,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,Let's just say that Bruce Wayne has his...eccentricities.
3401,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,I was not. But it wouldn't do him any good - Mr. Wayne still retains a clear majority. Miranda leaves. Fox moves into his office - stops.
3402,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"Bruce Wayne. As I live and breathe. Wayne rises, pushing hard on his cane."
3403,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,What brings you out of cryo-sleep Mr. Wayne?
3404,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I see you haven't lost your sense of humor...even if you have lost most of my money.
3405,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"Actually, you did that yourself. See, if you funnel the entire R and D budget for five years into a fusion project that you then mothball, your company is unlikely to thrive."
3406,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Even with -
3407,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"A wildly sophisticated CEO, yes. Wayne Enterprises is running out of time. And Daggett is moving in."
3408,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,What're my options?
3409,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,If you're not willing to turn your machine on -
3410,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"I can't, Lucius."
3411,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"Then sit tight. Your majority keeps Daggett at arm's length while we figure out a future for the energy program with Miranda Tate - she's supported your project all the way. She's smart, and quite lovely."
3412,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"You too, Lucius?"
3413,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"We all just want what's best for you, Bruce. Show her the machine."
3414,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I'll think it over.
3415,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,Anything else?
3416,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"No, why?"
3417,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,These conversations always used to end with some...unusual requests.
3418,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I retired.
3419,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"Let me show you some stuff, anyway. Fox hits a button - the bookcase opens into a hidden elevator."
3420,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I figured you'd have shut this place down.
3421,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"It was always shut down, officially."
3422,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,But all this new stuff?
3423,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"After your father died, Wayne Enterprises set up fourteen different defense subsidiaries. I've spent years shuttering them and consolidating all the prototypes under one roof. My roof."
3424,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Why?
3425,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"Stop them falling into the wrong hands. Besides, I thought someone might get some use out of them... Wayne shakes his head."
3426,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,Sure I can't tempt you to something? Pneumatic crampons? Infrared lenses? Least let me get you something for that leg.
3427,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,It's fine the use it gets these days.
3428,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"Well, then I have just the thing for an eccentric billionaire who doesn't like to walk... Fox opens a door - we glimpse a sleek vehicle. Wayne's eyes light up."
3429,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Now you're just showing off.
3430,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,Defense Department project for tight-geometry urban pacification. Rotors configured for maneuvering between buildings without recirculation.
3431,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,What's it called?
3432,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"It has a long and uninteresting Wayne Enterprises designation. So I took to calling it the Bat. And yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in black. Wayne touches its sleek side. Marveling."
3433,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,Works great except for the autopilot.
3434,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,What's wrong with that?
3435,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,Software-based instability. Take a better mind than mine to fix it.
3436,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Better mind?
3437,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"I was trying to be modest. A less busy mind. Yours, perhaps. Wayne looks wistfully at the machine. Turns away."
3438,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"I told you. I retired, Lucius."
3439,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,That's good -
3440,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,The Batman wasn't needed anymore. We won.
3441,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,What if he doesn't exist anymore?
3442,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I'm not sure if my assistant put me on the guest list -
3443,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Miss Tate, isn't it?"
3444,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"True. Proceeds go to the big fat spread, not the cause. It's not about charity, it's about feeding the ego of whichever society hag laid it on."
3445,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Oh.
3446,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,That's very generous of you.
3447,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Sometimes the investment doesn't pay off. Sorry.
3448,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Mind if I cut in? Rich Twit turns, annoyed - Wayne hands him his cane. Takes Selina by the waist. She glares at him."
3449,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,You don't seem very happy to see me.
3450,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Felt like some fresh air.
3451,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I have a powerful friend who deals with this kind of thing. Brazen costume for a cat burglar.
3452,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. Who's your date?"
3453,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,It's pronounced 'Ibeetha'. You wouldn't want these folks realizing you're a crook not a social climber.
3454,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I doubt you care what anyone in this room thinks about you.
3455,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came here from your walk-up in Old Town - modest place for a master jewel thief. Which means either you're saving for your retirement - or you're in deep with the wrong people."
3456,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Actually, I was born in the Regency Room."
3457,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Start fresh.
3458,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Or our achievements.
3459,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,You think that justifies stealing?
3460,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Robin Hood?
3461,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Maybe you're assuming too much.
3462,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Ouch.
3463,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Sounds like you're looking forward to it.
3464,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,These pearls do look better on you then they did in my safe...
3465,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Not likely.
3466,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I must have lost my ticket -
3467,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,My wife?
3468,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,This is Fox.
3469,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Remember those 'unusual requests' I used to make?
3470,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"I knew it! Up front, Alfred listens. Concerned."
3471,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"You start with the good limb so it learns your optimum muscle patterns. Wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee. Puts his weight on it - the knee bends, kicks. He sits again. Cautious. Now we tighten it up."
3472,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Not bad - Wayne executes a perfect roundhouse, knocking out a brick. Not bad at all."
3473,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I'm all ears.
3474,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Bane.
3475,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Born in a prison?
3476,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Bane was a member of the League of Shadows.
3477,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I didn't realize I was known for trifling with criminals.
3478,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Which was?
3479,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"If this man is all the things you say he is, then this city needs me. The Batsuit emerges from the cube."
3480,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"I tried helping as Bruce Wayne, Alfred. And I failed."
3481,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,That's what you're afraid of - that if I go back out there I'll fail.
3482,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,They just don't care.
3483,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,No guns. No killing.
3484,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Come on! Catwoman follows, confused, as Batman leaps off the roof. She gets to the edge, pauses to look down into the alley - sees the black angular roof of the Bat, cockpit open. Shots impact around her - she leaps, landing hard, but gracefully on the back of the vehicle, slides into the cockpit. As the engines thunder into life, and the canopy hisses shut, taking bullets from above."
3485,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"This isn't a car. Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky, downdraft forcing the Mercenaries down onto the roof, all but one, who walks slowly across the roof, strong against the wind...Bane. He watches the Bat roar off into the night."
3486,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,You're welcome.
3487,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Those weren't street thugs - they were trained killers. I saved your life. In return I need to know what you did with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints. Catwoman looks at him. Considering.
3488,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I doubt many people get the better of you.
3489,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,What were they going to do with them?
3490,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Miss Kyle -? But she is gone. So that's what that feels like.
3491,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"We bought all the neighbors. Alfred takes the cowl from him, then the cape, as they walk."
3492,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I retrieved this.
3493,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,They don't have the tools to analyze it.
3494,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,One man's tool is another man's weapon.
3495,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Alfred. Enough. The police weren't getting it done -
3496,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Perhaps you're upset you were wrong.
3497,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,You thought I didn't have it in me. Alfred looks at him. Puts down the cape and cowl.
3498,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"I'll fight harder, I always have."
3499,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,You said he was excommunicated.
3500,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,R¯'s al Gh¯l was the League of
3501,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Trades of some kind. Coded... The screen blanks, a thumb print appears."
3502,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Mine. Courtesy of Selina Kyle.
3503,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,You'd abandon me?
3504,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Rachel died knowing we'd decided to be together. That was my life beyond this cave and I can't just move on. She didn't. She couldn't.
3505,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"She was, I can't change that -"
3506,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Why would you say such a thing?
3507,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,You're lying.
3508,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,You're lying!
3509,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,How dare you use Rachel to stop me!
3510,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Sorry?! You expect to destroy my world, then shake hands?!"
3511,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"What does it mean, Alfred?!"
3512,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Goodbye, Alfred."
3513,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Alfred? But Alfred is gone.
3514,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,Answering your own door?
3515,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Yes. Could you decode the trades on that drive?
3516,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,I didn't need to. Page three. Wayne turns the page:
3517,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"It seems you made a series of large put options on the futures exchange. Verified by thumb print. The options expired at midnight last night. Wayne looks up from the newspaper, reeling."
3518,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"Long term we may be able to prove fraud, but for now...you're completely broke. And Wayne Enterprises is about to fall into the hands of John Daggett."
3519,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,The weapons - we can't let Daggett get his hands on Applied Sciences -
3520,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"Applied Sciences is shut up tight, and off the books. The energy project is a different story."
3521,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Miranda Tate. We need to convince the board to get behind her. Let's show her the reactor -
3522,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,We're meeting her there in thirty-five minutes. You better get dressed.
3523,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"Bear with me, Miss Tate. They arrive at a Portakabin and enter."
3524,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"Keep your hands and feet inside the car at all times. He hits a button and the floor descends, Miranda is shocked as the office becomes an elevator into -"
3525,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,The reactor is beneath the river so that it could be instantly flooded in an event of a security breach.
3526,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one. Miranda marvels as they step off the elevator. She spots a figure deep within: Bruce Wayne.
3527,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I thought you might like to see what your investment built.
3528,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"If it worked. It doesn't. Wayne leads Miranda to the core. Two perpendicular rings of electromagnets suspend a bowling-ball-sized mass of metal. Wayne hits buttons - the ball glows, then dies to cold."
3529,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Ignition, yes. But no chain reaction."
3530,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Miranda, if it were operational, the danger to Gotham would be too great."
3531,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Someone else will work out what Dr. Pavel did. Someone else will figure out how to turn this power source into a nuclear weapon. I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor.
3532,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Nothing. Until we can find a way to guarantee its safety.
3533,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Decommission it. Flood it.
3534,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,If the world's not ready. Yes.
3535,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I'm trusting you.
3536,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"I could've flooded this chamber any time in the last three years. I'm choosing to trust you, Miranda, and that's not the easiest thing for me. Please. His eyes are genuine. Pleading. Miranda nods."
3537,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,We have a board meeting to get to.
3538,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne."
3539,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I understand. Ladies and gentlemen.
3540,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,Right away.
3541,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,To protect the people closest to me.
3542,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"There are always people you care about. You just don't realize how much until they're gone. The idea was to be a symbol. Batman could be anybody, that was the point."
3543,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Not everybody agrees.
3544,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Got anything on Bane's whereabouts?
3545,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Don't wait. I'll get a cab.
3546,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Actually, no. Blake hands him some bills, watches him cross the street. The radio squawks. Blake reacts - drives off."
3547,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I don't think so.
3548,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Actually, they're letting me keep the house."
3549,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Vacation?
3550,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,My powerful friend hopes to change your mind about leaving.
3551,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,By giving you what you want.
3552,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,He says it does. He wants to meet. Tonight.
3553,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,He needs to find Bane. He thinks you'd know how.
3554,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"No, you're not."
3555,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,No. I'm on my own now.
3556,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Never needed them... She takes his hand.
3557,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Hope you don't like me for your money. Miranda kicks off her shoes. Glances at the paper.
3558,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,He left. Taking everything. Miranda puts the photo down. Kisses him. Passionately. Then again. He kisses back. Suddenly the lights go out.
3559,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,You're pretty good at that.
3560,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I assumed your family was wealthy.
3561,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"I've made a few myself. She turns to him, tracing the scars across his chest."
3562,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Someday perhaps. Not tonight. She pulls him close. He kisses her. They fold into each other, the warm heart at the center of a vast, cold room."
3563,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,That depends.
3564,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,On what you want it for. I acquired it to keep it out of the wrong hands.
3565,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Start by taking me to Bane.
3566,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Neither am I. Catwoman swings into a -
3567,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Me. Darkness smashes onto the Mercenary. Gunfire in the tunnel. Catwoman races along, pursued by a Mercenary. He is yanked off his feet by darkness - he screams... Batman picks off more and more Mercenaries. Screams echo... Batman follows Catwoman through the dark tunnel."
3568,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,You've made a serious mistake.
3569,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Bane.
3570,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Us? You were excommunicated. From a gang of psychopaths.
3571,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,No...
3572,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Why didn't you just kill me?
3573,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Where am I?
3574,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,I don't see the need for a board meeting on the energy project -
3575,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,Where are you taking us?
3576,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Do it for the pleasure.
3577,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Has anyone made it?
3578,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,What does he say?
3579,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Bane.
3580,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Don't.
3581,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,I won't do it. Fredericks trembles. Bane cocks the weapon.
3582,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,How would he know?
3583,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,How?
3584,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Is Bane the child you spoke of? Was he born here?
3585,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,How -?
3586,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I watched you die.
3587,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,You were the mercenary. Bane is your child. Your heir. INSERT CUT: the Mercenary at the side of the road. R¯'s.
3588,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,No...
3589,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I'm not meant to die in here. The Prisoner indicates the TV:
3590,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,You told me a child did it...
3591,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"Wayne Enterprises. Lucius Fox is there, with Miranda Tate."
3592,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,Miss Tate is fully aware of the situation.
3593,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"It was built as a fusion reactor. The first of its kind. Bane turned the core into a bomb, then disconnected it from the reactor."
3594,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"As the device's fuel cells decay, it's becoming increasingly unstable...until the point of detonation."
3595,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,And it will go off. In twenty-three days. Captain Jones reels at this news.
3596,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"I don't know, But I could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it."
3597,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"Take Miranda - Blake grabs Miranda, heads for the back stairs. Mercenaries jump out of the elevator, firing high."
3598,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,My body makes the jump.
3599,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,My soul's as ready to escape as my body.
3600,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I'm not afraid. I'm angry.
3601,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Why?
3602,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I do fear death. I fear dying in here while my city burns with no one there to save it.
3603,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,How?
3604,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"Pretty generous, for a thief. Selina recognizes the voice. Turns to find Wayne - strong, but weathered. Beard, work clothes."
3605,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Not yet.
3606,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,It wouldn't suit you. I need your help.
3607,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,For this. The 'Clean Slate'.
3608,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"I admit I felt a little let down. But I still think there's more to you. In fact, I think for you - this isn't a tool, it's an escape route. You want to disappear. Start fresh."
3609,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I can give you a way off. Once you've gotten me to Lucius Fox. I need you to find out where they're holding him. Then take me in.
3610,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,To save this city.
3611,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Maybe you do. But tomorrow that bomb's going off.
3612,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I'm trying. But I need Fox.
3613,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"You picked a hell of a time to go on vacation, Mr. Wayne."
3614,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,How long until the core ignites?
3615,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,That bomb goes off in twelve hours.
3616,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Unless we can connect it to the reactor.
3617,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,If you can get it there. I'll find a way to plug it back in. Can you get Miranda out?
3618,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Not tonight. I'm sorry.
3619,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,What for?
3620,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,To get me back in the game. Catwoman comes down the stairs with the Thugs.
3621,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I won't forget about you.
3622,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne."
3623,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Any move I make against Bane or the bomb - the triggerman sets it off.
3624,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"They can't be using radio or cell - too much interference. Infrared doesn't have the range. It could only be micro-burst long wave... Wayne opens a panel in the wall, takes out equipment: mini-mines, Batarangs, utility belt..."
3625,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Could you block it?
3626,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,Yes. I need the EMP cannon-guidance mount from the Bat. You remember where you parked? Wayne nods. Smiles. The Batsuit rises from the floor...
3627,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,She fly pretty well?
3628,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Even without the autopilot...
3629,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,Autopilot? That's what you're there for.
3630,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Light it up.
3631,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,This blocks the remote detonator signal to the bomb. Get it onto the truck by sunrise. They might hit the button when it starts.
3632,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,War.
3633,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"If you're working alone, wear a mask."
3634,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,The mask is not for you. It's to protect the people you care about.
3635,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,I lost someone once. Since then I break into their homes when they're sleeping and implant a tracking device on the back of their neck.
3636,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"On three - one, two, three - They throw the mini-mines at the rubble of the entrance - the blasts barely move any rubble."
3637,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,That's to warn the men on the other side. Batman disappears into the shadows.
3638,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,All-out assault on Bane...but you need to get the people you care about across the bridge.
3639,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,In case we fail. Lead an exodus across the bridge. Save as many lives as you can.
3640,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,You've given me an army. Now go. Blake nods. Turns to leave. Stops.
3641,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Don't thank me yet.
3642,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"The mid-town tunnel's blocked by debris, but the cannons give you enough firepower to make a path for people."
3643,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"To start it, you -"
3644,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,We've got forty-five minutes to save this city -
3645,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,With your help I might.
3646,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,There's more to you than that. She stares back at him. Facade slipping a touch.
3647,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Not everything. Not yet.
3648,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,No. I came back to stop you.
3649,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Give me the trigger! You'd never give it to an ordinary citizen - Bane's thrashing calms as he stares at Batman through pain-soaked eyes...gasping through his broken mask for relief.
3650,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"You thought you were the only one who could learn the strength to escape? Bane looks at Batman, curiosity behind his pain."
3651,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,He was trying to kill millions of innocent people -
3652,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Your knife may have been too slow... A Mercenary steps forward -
3653,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,"I need you on the ground, me in the air, we have to force that convoy east, to the entrance to the"
3654,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,Two minutes. I can fly it out over the bay...
3655,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,No autopilot. She takes this in. He stands to face her.
3656,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,So did you.
3657,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,And you were right.
3658,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,BATMAN,A hero can be anyone. That was always the point.
3659,Dark-Knight-Rises-The,FOX,"Please, I just need to know what I could've done to fix it."
3660,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Yes, sir."
3661,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"No, no, no! What do you mean she's not coming?! I have a backyard full of these little girls who are counting on a visit from a fairy princess!"
3662,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Ah! Hurts! Ah! Stop it!
3663,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Listen! I don't want a refund! I want a fairy princess... please! Please, I am begging you. You know what? I hope that you can sleep at night, you crusher of little girls' dreams!!!"
3664,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Any minute now!
3665,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Stall them.
3666,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Aaaaaahh!
3667,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"It is I, Gru...zinkerbell! The most magical fairy princess of all! And I am here to wish Princess Agnes a very happy birthday!"
3668,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Because my house is made of candy and sometimes I eat instead of facing my problems.
3669,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Okay! Time for cake!
3670,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"You are welcome, little girl."
3671,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Hello, Jillian."
3672,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"No, no, no, get off of the limb right now. No limb."
3673,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"No, Jill's, that is not happening. Seriously. I'm fine."
3674,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,No.
3675,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,I'm sorry. I did not see you there.
3676,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Or there.
3677,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Kyle... Kyle!
3678,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Ky--Kyle! No, do not do your business on the petunias!"
3679,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,There you go. Those are Fred's. Go crazy.
3680,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Good boy.
3681,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Wha? I didn't... What... Yes?
3682,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde of the AVL. Oh. Whoops. Sorry, you're gonna have to come with me."
3683,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Oh, sorry, I--Freeze Ray! DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 9."
3684,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"You know you really should announce your weapons after you fire them, Mr. Gru. For example--"
3685,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Lipstick Taser! Oh, it works so good."
3686,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Man. Ugh. Large...person.
3687,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Oh...sorry!
3688,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Get...in...there...you...big...man!
3689,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Ugh...ooh...what...where...ah...oh, foot's asleep...ah...pins and needles..."
3690,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Ehhh...
3691,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"I don't. I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I am not gonna lie--I enjoyed that. Every second of it. Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually."
3692,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Sorry, sir."
3693,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Okay, this is bogus!"
3694,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"I don't know who you people think you are, but--"
3695,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"First of all, you've got no proof that I did that. Second, after I did do that, I put it back!"
3696,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Oh, me now...?"
3697,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Um, recently an entire top secret lab disappeared from the Arctic Circle. Yeah, the entire lab. Just whoosh. Voom! Gone. Where did it go? DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 14."
3698,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,I don't care.
3699,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"The lab was devoted to experiments involving PX-41, a transmutation serum. What is PX-41, you ask? Mmmm, it's pretty bad... Look."
3700,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Oh!
3701,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Hmm, you usually don't see that in bunnies."
3702,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Ha! A mall? DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 15.
3703,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"The plan is to set you up undercover at a shop in the mall, where hopefully you'll be able to--"
3704,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Okay, I see where this is going, with all the Mission Impossible stuff, but no. No! I am a father now. And a legitimate businessman. I am developing a line of delicious jams and jellies."
3705,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Oh, attitude! That's right! So thanks, but no thanks. And here's a tip--instead of tasing people and kidnapping them, maybe you should just give them a call! Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt!"
3706,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Oh, yeah, like that's any better!"
3707,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but your work as a villain was kind of amazing, so if you ever want to get back to doing something awesome--give us a call."
3708,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Hey, I told you guys to get to bed."
3709,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,What?
3710,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Yeah, well, she is a nutjob. And I'm not going on any date. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 17."
3711,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Hey Lisa, I was wondering if you--"
3712,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Scared? Of what? Women?! No, that's bonkers! I just-- I have no interest in going on a date, that's all. Case closed. I'm not scared-- of women... or dates... let's go to bed."
3713,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Goodnight, Edith."
3714,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Goodnight, Margo."
3715,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Well, hold the horses. Who are you texting?"
3716,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Avery... Avery? Is that a girl's name or a boy's name?
3717,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"No, no, it doesn't matter... Unless it's a boy!"
3718,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Uh...oooh...you...do?
3719,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Oh, yes..."
3720,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Goodnight, Agnes. Never get older."
3721,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Hey, Tim, nice haircut!"
3722,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Donnie, hang in there, baby! It's almost Friday."
3723,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"So, how's today's batch, Dr. Nefario?"
3724,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,That tastes good... Love the flavor of that...
3725,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"No! No! Oh, we're making great progress! Here, try some of this."
3726,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Whoa... okay, just because everybody hates it doesn't mean it's not good."
3727,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,What? What's wrong?
3728,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Well, I'm also considering a line of jams..."
3729,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Dr. Nefario! Come on, you're kidding, right?"
3730,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Very well. Let us give you the proper send-off. Minions!
3731,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,The highest honor awarded. To Dr. Nefario for your years of service. The twenty-one fart gun salute!
3732,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Good morning, girls! I have an announcement to make."
3733,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Ummm...Bruce Willis.
3734,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Okay, what are you doing?"
3735,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Oh, okay...WHAT?! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
3736,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,No! Stop! No one is ever getting out there! Ever!
3737,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Okay, now for the announcement: I have accepted a new job."
3738,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Yes, I have been recruited by a top secret agency to go undercover and save the world!"
3739,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"That's right, baby! Gru's back in the game! With gadgets and weapons and cool cars...the whole deal."
3740,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Yes. Yes I am.
3741,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Hm. ""Bake My Day."" Blech."
3742,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Alright, here is the cupcake recipe I got off the internet."
3743,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,And don't go nuts with the sprinkles!
3744,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Ha! Yaa! Ho! Ooof! Zaaa! Ay-ay- ay-ay-ay!
3745,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Whoo. Wasn't expecting that. Or was I?
3746,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Ooh... you got... You got... a little...
3747,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Here, I'll-- I'll get it."
3748,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Oh, that's just spreading...um..."
3749,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Alright, alright. I got it. I got it!... Stop it!"
3750,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Oh! I'll let you get it.
3751,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Yeah, what you just saw there was a little something new I've been working on. It's a combination of Jujitsu, Krav Maga, Aztec warfare, and krumping."
3752,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Okay, that's weird--why are you here?"
3753,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,On assignment from Silas. I'm your new partner. Yay!
3754,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"What?! No, no ""yay."" Ramsbottom didn't say anything about a partner."
3755,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Well, seems that because of your checkered past, everyone else refused to work with you. But not me. I stepped up. And I'm new, so I kind of have to do what they tell me anyway."
3756,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,You know this guy?
3757,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Yes, he's one of my minions."
3758,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Oh, I'm sorry. I should have known."
3759,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,You're free to go. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 29.
3760,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Dave...
3761,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Earth to Dave! You can leave now.
3762,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Now, what do we got? Who's on the list? Fire `em at me."
3763,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"First suspect...Hedda Blumentoft, proprietor of Mum's the Word Floral Shop."
3764,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,No. Not her.
3765,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Okay, moving on..."
3766,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Chuck Kinney, owner of ""Stuff-A- Bear."""
3767,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Ooh.
3768,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,I don't think so.
3769,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Oh!
3770,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Gru. And this is Lucy. And we are closed.
3771,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Look away!
3772,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,You-- Whoa... Hooo...
3773,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,El Macho.
3774,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,What?
3775,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,But it couldn't be... DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 32.
3776,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Wha-- What? What couldn't be??
3777,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,That guy looks exactly like a villain named El Macho. From about twenty years ago.
3778,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"He was ruthless. He was dangerous. And as the name implies, very macho."
3779,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,He had a reputation for pulling off heists using only his bare hands.
3780,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Ah, but sadly, like all the greats, El Macho was gone too soon. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 33."
3781,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,He died in the most macho way possible.
3782,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Riding a shark with 250 pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest into the mouth of an active volcano.
3783,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,It was glorious.
3784,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Yeah, sounds like El Macho's pretty dead..."
3785,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,They never found the body. Oh no. All that was ever retrieved was a pile of singed chest hair. But... that face. It has got to be El Macho.
3786,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Then what do you say you and I break into his restaurant? Tonight.
3787,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Yes, that's good, because I'm telling you--if anybody in this place has the PX-41 serum..."
3788,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,...it's him.
3789,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Alright, alright, homework done, pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for bed."
3790,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,I just... I have a lot of work to do.
3791,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Very important business. So...hugs, kisses... ...good night, sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs blah-blah-blah-blah- blah--"
3792,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Fine, fine... Let me hear it. Quickly. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 35."
3793,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Wow! That was...something else. I really liked the way you smiled at the end. Let's try this one more time, but a teensy bit less like a zombie, okay?"
3794,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Perfect! Time to go!
3795,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Well, what do you mean? Why not?"
3796,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Well, you don't need one to do the show. I mean, you did the Veterans Day Pageant and you haven't been in combat."
3797,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Okay, well, then...maybe you can just use your imagination."
3798,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Yes, right. You can do that, can't you?"
3799,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Alright, hey, hey-- No, no, no, no! Hey, please!"
3800,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Kevin, Jerry, watch the girls for me, okay? Dave, Stuart--come this way. With me! Come on!"
3801,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Come on!
3802,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,We're stealth ninjas. We make no sound.
3803,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Right. Gotcha.
3804,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Alright, El Macho, you're going down."
3805,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Wait! Wait!
3806,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,What?
3807,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,What are you doing?
3808,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,I'm checking for laser beam alarm triggers.
3809,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,It's a restaurant!
3810,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,You never know what kind of booby traps this guy could have set. Huh? C'mon!
3811,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,There are no booby traps!
3812,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Ha! Booby!
3813,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Oh. There's a chicken. Are you lost little guy? You must be lost!
3814,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Ha! Some guard dog.
3815,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiigh!
3816,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Get it off of me! Get it off of me! Get it off of me!
3817,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,I got you!
3818,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,I got it! Ha!
3819,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Ha! DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 41.
3820,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Oh!
3821,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Ugh...
3822,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"What is wrong with that chicken? Hey, that pollo? Es loco."
3823,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"No? Okay, let's go."
3824,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,You getting anything?
3825,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"No. Not yet. But hey, maybe you can find something with these x-ray goggles."
3826,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Bah...
3827,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"How're they working? Tell me, tell me!"
3828,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Ahh! Ooof!
3829,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,What's wrong? Something wrong?
3830,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Oh, that's an image I'll never get out of my brain. Blagh!"
3831,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,I knew it!
3832,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,The serum is in here!
3833,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Ooh, then let's get it!"
3834,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Oh, this is going to be good! Ahh..."
3835,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,A-ha! What? It's... salsa?
3836,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Awww man. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 43.
3837,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Gru, call one of your munchkins!"
3838,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,We've been spotted! Come get us!
3839,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Hm. Subtle.
3840,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Over here, over here! Over... here."
3841,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Hold tight!
3842,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"All right, there he is. Suspect #8: Floyd Eaglesan."
3843,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Oh. Okay.
3844,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,See if you can get closer. Go...go.
3845,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Alright, what do--"
3846,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Oh no. That's not good.
3847,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Oh! Girls! What are you doing here?
3848,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...funny."
3849,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Hey, there you are. Oh, who's this?"
3850,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Lucy, these are my girls, Margo, Edith and Agnes. Girls, Lucy. Lucy, girls."
3851,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Oh! Goodness...
3852,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Oh! Hey! I have an idea! Since Lucy and I have lots of work to do, why don't you girls go and explore the mall!"
3853,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Here is some money. Go buy some useless mall junk! Some headbands, and--"
3854,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Are you out of your gourd? No! She just works with me.
3855,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Okay, stop! That is a song of lies. I don't even like her! Now go have fun!"
3856,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Ha, ha, ha! Kids...right? They're...funny."
3857,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Those girls totally adore you. I bet you're a fun dad.
3858,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Huh. I am pretty fun.
3859,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"All right, I'm going in."
3860,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,If it picks up any traces of the serum the sensor in your belt buckle--
3861,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,--will make a sound like this-- MEE- MO-MEE-MO-MEE-MO!!!
3862,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Okay! I get it! I get it!
3863,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,You...know my name?
3864,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,I'm getting nothing so far. I think you need to move around. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 53.
3865,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Wow, this looks interesting. What is it?"
3866,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,No serum.
3867,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Yeah, not so much."
3868,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Oh, how about this impressive trinket?"
3869,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Nothing.
3870,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Yeah, I don't care."
3871,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,MEE-MO-MEE-MO-MEE-MO!!! Hold on. I'm picking up something! Behind that wall! DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 54.
3872,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Ah! And what do we have here?
3873,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,No thanks. So what's on the other side of the wall?
3874,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Gru?
3875,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Date??? Boyfriend??? What???
3876,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Oh, no, no, no! Do not say that they are...no no no, no!"
3877,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Margo. What is going on here?
3878,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Me llama-lama-ding-dong, who cares. Let's go."
3879,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,What the-- Father?!
3880,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Oh... look at you.
3881,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Haha. He likes me!
3882,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Well, we really should be going. Girls, come on."
3883,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"No! You know, they're not in love. They hardly know each other!"
3884,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"No, no, I am--"
3885,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Yes, but there has been a new development, and I'm telling you, this is the guy. You need to arrest him immediately. And his deviously charming son. I'm pretty sure that the son is involved, too. The son also. You've got to get the son."
3886,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,I think that the son is the mastermind. There's a look. There's a devilish look in his eyes and I don't like it!
3887,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Evidence schmevidence! I go with my gut, and my gut tells me that this guy is El Macho! Lock him up! Lock up the son. Don't forget about the son. The kid gives me the creeps!"
3888,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Uh, but, on the less... ...""crazy"" side of things, uh, Gru discovered traces of the serum at Eagle Hair Club. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 59."
3889,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Yeah, and you know who made that happen? Huh? This guy. Nailed it. Amazing, right?"
3890,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"No. I mean, sure, but it's not him. It is... ...El Macho."
3891,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,No. It is him! And I will prove it!
3892,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Gru, c'mon!"
3893,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,He really thinks it's El Macho. Can you tell?
3894,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Kevin, the wi-fi's out! Kevin?"
3895,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Hey, Lance! Where the heck is Kevin?"
3896,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Alright, we need to revisit the number of vacation days you guys get. I can't find anybody anymore!"
3897,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Agnes! Agnes! Tell Jillian I'm not here!
3898,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Yes, I hear you."
3899,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Well...
3900,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Ah. I can tell.
3901,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"We are in a restaurant, you know."
3902,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Hi. Takeout for Lucy?
3903,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Ah. Well, thank you very much. I was--"
3904,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Hahaha. Hoooo. Is it hot in here? Oof. How's the food? DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 64.
3905,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,What? Ah! I don't think so.
3906,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Oh. What? No. These locks are all mine...
3907,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"I don't think so, Miss Lady."
3908,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Hello... Hello, are you...?"
3909,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Hey, Gru."
3910,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Hello, Lucy, how you doin'...? DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 65."
3911,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Wow, looks like your date's out for the count. It's like she's been shot with a mild moose tranquilizer."
3912,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Yeah, I'm winking `cuz that's what actually happened."
3913,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Oh, she's just uh--"
3914,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Shall we take her home?
3915,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Well, I think you did it. You just officially had the worst date ever."
3916,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Huh, tell me about it."
3917,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Don't worry--it can only get better from here, right? But if it doesn't, you can always borrow my dart gun. I've had to use it on one or two dates myself."
3918,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Yeah, you know, as far as dates go, I think I'm good with just the one."
3919,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Well, good night, partner."
3920,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,This was fun.
3921,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Yes. Surprisingly, it was."
3922,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Oh, and uh, just between you and me? You look much better bald. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 67."
3923,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,See you tomorrow!
3924,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Quack! Quack! Quack!
3925,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,No! It was horrible!
3926,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,High-five!
3927,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Bump it.
3928,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Mr. Ramsbottom?
3929,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,What are you doing here?
3930,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Got who?
3931,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Ah. Alright. So...what now?
3932,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Australia...?
3933,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Hey there.
3934,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Hey.
3935,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,So...we got him.
3936,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Yay. That's great. And now you're going to Australia?
3937,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Well, it's not definite yet. Still figuring it out. Already been working on my accent. Wallaby. Diggeri-doo. Hugh Jackman. So...um. Pretty excited..."
3938,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Great. Well...good luck.
3939,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Thanks. You too. Oh. Here. I wanted to give you this.
3940,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Your lipstick taser?
3941,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Yeah, it's just a memento. Just, you know, from the first time we met."
3942,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Oh. Thank you, Lucy."
3943,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Well... it looks like they need you, so..."
3944,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Yeah, I uh, I better go. Bye, Gru."
3945,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Ah, thank you."
3946,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Remember when you said that I liked Lucy? Well, it turns out...you're right."
3947,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Yes, but...well, she's moving away. I'm never going to see her again."
3948,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Oh, I don't--I don't think so, sweetheart."
3949,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"""Hello, Lucy. This is Gru. I know up to this point our relationship has been strictly professional, and you're leaving for Australia and all, but..."" Okay, here is the question. ""Would you like to--to go out on a date?"""
3950,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Okay, that's not helping."
3951,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,All right. Here we go. For real this time. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 73.
3952,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,I can do this.
3953,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Agh! I hate you!
3954,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Ah.
3955,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Okay. Let's party. Ah? But first let's go over the rules. Because what is fun without the rules?
3956,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Agnes, easy on the churros."
3957,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Edith, try not to kill anyone."
3958,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Margo--
3959,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Aghhh! Okay...
3960,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,There must be the standard six feet of space between you and boys. Especially this boy.
3961,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Oh, nothing. Nothing is wrong. I'm just chilling with the guac...from my chip hat."
3962,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,How did you know?
3963,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,You?
3964,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,What the--oh!
3965,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Huh.
3966,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Oooh!
3967,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Aaaahhh...
3968,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Oh!
3969,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Aaaahhh!
3970,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Oooohhh.
3971,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Aha! Ha ha ha--
3972,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Oh!
3973,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Ouch! DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 80.
3974,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Say what?
3975,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,I choose Gru. I CHOOSE GRU!
3976,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Thank you, Gru stewardess!"
3977,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Ha ha! I knew it! You are El Macho!
3978,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Nobody believed me! Ho ho! But I knew you weren't dead! DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 82.
3979,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Dr. Nefario?
3980,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Whaaat? This-- So, this is your new job opportunity?"
3981,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Oh! Kevin? Agh!
3982,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Together?
3983,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Uh...yeah...probably...
3984,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"I mean, yes! Yes. Of course, yes, I just have a lot going on right now...I just need to get some things off my plate before we start taking over the world, that's all."
3985,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"No--no, forget it! One hundred percent! I am in! I think--what is--do you hear that-- I do. That's Agnes calling me from on the surf--"
3986,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Totally in!
3987,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Edith! Agnes! Come on!
3988,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Ooof!
3989,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,We need to go home now! Where's Margo?
3990,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Margo!
3991,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Come on, we're leav--hey, what's wrong?"
3992,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Yes...they stink. Sorry, honey, we've got to go."
3993,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Oops, sorry!"
3994,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Oh, hey! Eduardo!"
3995,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Oh, speaking of Gru...uh, have you seen him? I really need to talk to him."
3996,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Oh, I don't know. I mean close... I wouldn't say we were close. Why, did he say we were close? Did he say that? DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 87."
3997,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Hey!
3998,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"No, it is not cool. Plus, I pretty much knew it was him all along, so if anyone's cool, it's me."
3999,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Well, Dr. Nefario... DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 88."
4000,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Lucy? Wha--that's impossible! She's on her way to Australia...
4001,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Not for long.
4002,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Come on. We're getting her out of there.
4003,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Hey, guys. Come on! Stay focused here!"
4004,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Curses. Foiled again. These guys captured me.
4005,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Run!
4006,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Up that tree! Hurry, hurry!"
4007,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Hey, hey! Nice work, Dr. Nefario!"
4008,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Thank you, Doctor! Now let's go get the--"
4009,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,You brought the girls?
4010,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,You guys take care of the rest of the minions. I'm going to find Lucy.
4011,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"It's over, El Macho. Now where is Lucy?"
4012,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Oh, hey Gru! Turns out you were right about the whole El Macho thing, huh? Yay!"
4013,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,No!
4014,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Lipstick taser!
4015,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Aw...he copied me.
4016,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Don't worry about me, Gru! I'll be fine. I have survived lots worse than this. Okay, that's not entirely true. I'm actually kind of freaking out up here!"
4017,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Don't worry--I will get you out of this!
4018,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,I really hate that chicken.
4019,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Is there a red one? It's usually the red one.
4020,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Gru, anytime now!"
4021,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Listen, Lucy--we may not get out of this alive, so I need to ask you a question."
4022,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Uh, better make it quick!"
4023,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"If I'd asked you out on a date, what would you have said?"
4024,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Are you kidding me?! Yes!
4025,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,JUMP!!!
4026,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,Oh! Lucy! Lucy! Where are you?!
4027,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,"Oh, Lucy!"
4028,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,Gru! DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 99.
4029,Despicable-Me-2,LUCY,"Sorry...I guess you kind of need your arms to tread water, huh?"
4030,Despicable-Me-2,GRU,They'll be back...
4031,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the medical school? I'm supposed to be giving a lecture in twenty minutes and my driver's a bit lost."
4032,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I couldn't help noticing the accent. You from Jersey?
4033,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Austria? You're kidding. Well, g'day, mate. What do you say we get together later and throw a few shrimp on the barbie."
4034,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Guess I won't be going Down Under tonight...
4035,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,This is 22.
4036,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Cool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my way."
4037,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Okay, gang, single file. You know the rules: No pushing, no humping, and no sniffing heinies..."
4038,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"The same reason you're not on a leash, sir because it's demeaning and it chafes like hell."
4039,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,You kids stay right here...
4040,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Hey, wait a minute!"
4041,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Hello. I'll be just a minute...
4042,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Why you going to the airport? Flying somewhere?
4043,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,How'd you guess?
4044,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Well, I saw your luggage, then when I noticed the airline ticket, I put two and two together. So where you heading?"
4045,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Aspen.
4046,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Oh, you're gonna love it. I hear California's beautiful this time of year. Mary looks back out the window and Lloyd sneaks another glance."
4047,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas.
4048,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,I'm Mary.
4049,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Uh, this isn't my real job, you know. It's only temporary."
4050,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Oh?
4051,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I are saving up our money so we can open our own pet store."
4052,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,That's nice.
4053,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I got worms.
4054,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,I beg your pardon?
4055,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"That's what we're gonna call it: I Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in selling worm farms you know, like ant farms. A lot of people don't realize that worms make much better pets than ants. They're quiet, affectionate, they don't bite, and they're super with the kids."
4056,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"Aren't ants quiet, too?"
4057,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Uh... well, sure but they aren't half as affectionate. And if you cut an ant's head off, it won't grow back."
4058,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,I see.
4059,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"And best of all, worm farming is a seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year industry. I wouldn't mind having a piece of that pie, if you know what I mean."
4060,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,What's the matter? Little tense about the flight?
4061,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Something like that.
4062,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"It's really nothing to worry about, Mary. Statistically, they say you're more likely to get killed on the way to the airport. You know, like in a head-on crash, or something."
4063,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"Um, Lloyd, could please keep your eyes on the road."
4064,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Good thinking. There's a lot of bad rivers out there.
4065,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Here you go.
4066,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Keep it. It was my pleasure.
4067,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Relax, Mary. Just get trashed and pass out. You'll be there before you know it."
4068,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Thanks Lloyd. And good luck with your worms.
4069,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Drive around me, you pinhead!"
4070,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Damn!
4071,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,You can't do this! I'll lose my job!
4072,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,I got fired again.
4073,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"I don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but let's face it, you are one pathetic loser. No offense."
4074,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"None taken. Were you shitcanned, too?"
4075,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Of course not. I quit.
4076,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Why'd you quit?
4077,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire me.
4078,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Why didn't you wait and see if your suspicions were well-founded?
4079,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Winners control their own destiny, Har."
4080,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"You know, the thing that really chaps my ass is that I just spent my life savings turning my van into a poodle. The alarm alone cost me two hundred."
4081,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Big deal. That car's an old bomb anyway.
4082,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,What are you talking about? It's only six years old.
4083,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,That's forty-two in dog years.
4084,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,What's with the briefcase?
4085,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,It's a love memento.
4086,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Huh?
4087,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"The most beautiful woman alive. Her name was Mary. I drove her to the airport. Sparks flew, emotions ran high, breasts heaved. She left this case in the terminal and flew to Aspen and out of my life. End of story."
4088,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,What's in it?
4089,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,DO you really expect me to go snooping around in someone else's private property?
4090,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Why not?
4091,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,It's locked.
4092,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Friend or foe?
4093,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,We don't have any friends.
4094,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Can't recognize them. Could be student loan thugs again, or the IRS, or maybe somebody pissed off about that case of Girl Scout cookies you bounced a check on."
4095,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Hey, I ordered Mystic Mint. The little swindlers gave me Peanut Butter Praline."
4096,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Well, whoever they are, they look serious. One of them's even wearing plaid."
4097,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,That's a hostile pattern. I say we bail and get down to unemployment.
4098,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Blew it? For your information, we only missed three days in two months."
4099,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Yeah, and that was because of a blizzard"
4100,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Come on, Stan. I'm sure you can find something else for us. How about another crack at that Suicide Hotline?"
4101,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Give me what's left of our dough. I'll go to the corner and buy a few necessities.
4102,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"What's cheaper, Thunderbird or Night Train?"
4103,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Get Robitussin it's a better buzz.
4104,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Excuse me, little old lady, do you have change for a dollar?"
4105,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Well could you do me a favor and guard this while I go break a dollar? My wallet's locked in this machine.
4106,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Where's the booze?
4107,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"It's gone. I got robbed by Grandma Walton. She got my wallet, too."
4108,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Come on, man, cheer up. We've been own before. I'm sure we'll land on our heads somewhere."
4109,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"It gets worse, Lloyd. My parakeet Petey he's... he's dead."
4110,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Oh man, I'm sorry, Harry. What happened?"
4111,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,His head fell off.
4112,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,His head fell off?
4113,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Yeah, he was pretty old."
4114,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I don't suppose he had a warranty...?
4115,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Nah, I bought him used."
4116,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"That's it! I've had it with this ump! We don't have food, we don't have jobs, our pets' heads are falling off, we're surrounded by roving gangs of larcenous old"
4117,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Okay, calm down."
4118,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,No I won't calm down.
4119,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"What the hell are we doing here anyway, Harry? We've got to get out of this town."
4120,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Yeah, and go where?"
4121,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"I'll tell you where: someplace warm, a place where the beer flows like wine, where beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of Capistrano. I'm talking about Aspen."
4122,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Aspen?
4123,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"That's right, Aspen."
4124,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I don't know, Lloyd, the French are assholes."
4125,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Let me ask you something: do you want to end up like Petey dead in some flea-ridden apartment, face- down on a Dear Abby column, with a soggy sunflower seed pressed against your beak? Or do you want to enjoy your life? Come on, Harry, don't let Petey's eath be in vain. Don't you see what he was saying? Spread your wings, man. he was saying? Spread your wings, man. Fly."
4126,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"What are you talking about, Lloyd? His head fell off. Wait a second, I know what you're up to. You just wanna go to Aspen so you can find that girl who lost her briefcase and you need me to drive you there."
4127,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,That's bullshit. I'll drive. And what's so wrong about going someplace where we know someone who can plug us into the social pipeline?
4128,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I don't know, Lloyd. I think we should stay here, hunt for jobs, and keep saving money for the worm store. I'm getting a little sick and tired of always running from creditors."
4129,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"You know what I'm sick and tired of, Harry? I'm sick and tired of having to eek my way through life. I'm sick and tired of being a nobody."
4130,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"But most of all, I'm sick and tired of having nobody."
4131,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Come on, Lloyd. Give us a kiss."
4132,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"On the other hand, maybe you're right, Harry. Maybe we should stay here and try our luck in bankruptcy court. With all those lawsuits against us, I'm sure we'll win at least one. It could be a boost to our egos."
4133,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Petey, I made a promise to you once, man... ...and I'll be damned if I can remember what it was."
4134,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Well, we're finally doing it. Do you realize that in all the years we've known each other, this is the first time we've done this together."
4135,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Been run out of town?
4136,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Taken a trip.
4137,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Why'd you do that?
4138,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,What?
4139,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Take your seatbelt off.
4140,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Because we just cleared the danger zone.
4141,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Huh?
4142,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Don't you know anything, Lloyd? Ninety percent of all accidents happen within five miles of home. We've already traveled 6.3 miles."
4143,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Well what about the people who live around here? What if we got into an accident with one of them?
4144,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Where'd you get those?
4145,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Bought 'em when we filled up.
4146,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Lloyd, I thought we agreed to confer on all expenditures. We're on a tight budget, remember?"
4147,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"This didn't come out of our travel fund. I was able to scrape up twenty- five bucks before we left. You know, so we could live in style."
4148,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Where'd you get twenty-five extra bucks?
4149,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I sold some stuff to Billy in 4-C.
4150,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,You mean the blind kid?
4151,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,That's right.
4152,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"What did you sell him, Lloyd?"
4153,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Just some odds and ends.
4154,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Specifically?
4155,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of marbles, Petey, three comic books a second, are you telling me you sold my dead bird to a blind kid? Well who else was I gonna sell it to?"
4156,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"But Lloyd, Petey didn't even have a head."
4157,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Put your mind at ease, friend. I took care of it."
4158,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,How far have we gone?
4159,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"According to this map, about an inch and a half."
4160,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Shit. We're gonna need a smaller map or we'll never get there. We don't have enough gas money.
4161,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Relax. We have more than enough.
4162,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I believe you're wrong, Lloyd."
4163,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"And I believe I'm right, Harry."
4164,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I still say wrong, Lloyd."
4165,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,How much you wanna bet?
4166,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,I don't bet.
4167,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,What do you mean you don't bet?
4168,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I mean I don't gamble, you know that. Never have and never will."
4169,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Oh, bull. I'll bet you our next meal that I can get you gambling before the day's out."
4170,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"There's no way, Lloyd. You can't do it."
4171,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"I'll give you three-to-one odds. That's three feedbags if you win, against only one if you lose."
4172,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"You're wasting your money, Lloyd. I already told you, I don't gamble."
4173,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Okay, five-to-one I can get you gambling before the day's out."
4174,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Sorry, pal, no way."
4175,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Make it ten-to-one. Harry sticks out his hand.
4176,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"You got yourself a bet, sucker!"
4177,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,What's the soup du jour?
4178,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Sounds tasty. I'll have a bowl.
4179,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Actually, this chocolate milk isn't mixed very well. Could you please bring me a spoon?"
4180,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Uh-oh...
4181,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,What's the matter?
4182,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"You spilled the salt. That's bad luck. We're driving across the country and the last thing we need is bad luck. Quick, toss a handful of salt over your right shoulder."
4183,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,What for?
4184,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Because that's good luck.
4185,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Or was it the left shoulder?
4186,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"It was a terrible accident, Sir. Believe me, I would never do anything to offend a man of your size. Please accept my most sincere apology."
4187,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Um... the thought had crossed my mind.
4188,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Nah, you go ahead."
4189,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Perfect. I'm out eight bucks and I still haven't eaten.
4190,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Well if you'd stop picking fights with the locals... Wait a second. I think I just had an idea. Follow me...
4191,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Excuse me, gentlemen, I'd just like to apologize for that unpleasant scene a little earlier."
4192,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"What I'm trying to say is, my friend and I would like to buy you guys a round of beers, just to bury the hatchet."
4193,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Whatever you want, sir. I'll have the waitress send them over. Oh, and fellas hope to see you again down the road."
4194,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Lloyd, what are you doing? You know we can't afford to buy them drinks."
4195,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Um, Sea Bass and the fellas offered to pick up our check. They said just add this to their tab."
4196,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Well, if that guy at the table over there is Sea Bass..."
4197,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Oh, and put these on there, too."
4198,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"By the way, how far is it to Rhode Island from here?"
4199,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I just wish we could've seen Sea Bass's face when he got the bill.
4200,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,I hope we never have to.
4201,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Don't worry. That fish-head is probably half-way to Providence by now.
4202,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,I hope so.
4203,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Hey, stop the car. I gotta take a whiz."
4204,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Are you crazy? I'm not stopping now. What if they figure out we went the other way. They'll be on us in no time.
4205,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,But I gotta go. What am I supposed to do?
4206,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Hold it.
4207,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I can't hold it. I'm about to explode.
4208,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Well... just take a whiz in an empty beer bottle. There's a couple on the floor in the back seat.
4209,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Are you serious?
4210,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Yes, I'm serious. I'm not stopping now. We could get killed. Lloyd SIGHS. He takes an EMPTY BEER BOTTLE from the back seat and UNZIPS his fly. Suddenly we hear a PEEING SOUND. Then:"
4211,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Uh-oh...
4212,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,What's the matter?
4213,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,The bottle's almost full and I'm still going.
4214,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Well stop going.
4215,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"I can't stop once I already started, you know that. Quick, get me another bottle."
4216,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Jesus, be careful! You almost went off the road."
4217,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I'm sorry, Lloyd. I'm doing the best I can."
4218,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Here, hold this."
4219,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"What are you, a goddamn camel?"
4220,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Hey, I haven't gone all day."
4221,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Huh?
4222,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"No, it's a Cardigan! But thanks for noticing!"
4223,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Jesus, what is this, the fashion police?"
4224,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Yes, sir, we had a little... ifficulty in the car."
4225,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"No, sir."
4226,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Oh, that's nothing, sir."
4227,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"But, your honor, he's telling the truth. It's not beer."
4228,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Sir, I wouldn't TROOPER --You'd keep your mouth shut if you knew what was good for you."
4229,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"YOU WOULD, TOO..."
4230,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"How does that feel, Lloyd?"
4231,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,How's the other side?
4232,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Nothing. Nothing at all.
4233,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"Lloyd, will you wash my nipples...?"
4234,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I don't know, Lloyd, I feel a little sleazy staying here when we're not even engaged."
4235,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Hey, it's the only motel that charges by the hour. We can't afford anything else."
4236,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Yep, this sure is the life. Cold beer, a hot tube, and fuzzy pink sheets... You know, there's only one thing that could make this moment any better."
4237,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,What's that?
4238,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,If you had a nice set of knockers.
4239,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"That's two things, Lloyd."
4240,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Right now I'd settle for one.
4241,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I don't know, Lloyd, these places just don't do it for me. Brings back too many memories."
4242,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"What happened, Harry? Some little filly break your heart?"
4243,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Nah, it was a girl. Fraida Felcher. We stayed at a place like this once No-Tell Motel out on Route 31."
4244,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Felcher? You mean the babe who worked for the tractor company?
4245,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"The same. We had this incredibly romantic time. Boy, I thought we'd be together forever. Then about a week later, right out of the blue, she sends me a John Deere letter."
4246,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"That's cold, Har. Give you any reason?"
4247,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,I called her up and she gave me some crap about me not listening to her enough or something like that. I wasn't really paying attention.
4248,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Thing that really hurts is I think she was seeing another guy. Never id find out who.
4249,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,It just doesn't make any sense. I left the money exactly where they instructed me to.
4250,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,But I'd never forgive myself if something happened to Melvin.
4251,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"It's not her fault, Daddy. We're all a little on edge."
4252,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"Thank you, Daddy."
4253,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,You're it.
4254,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,You're it.
4255,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,You're it. Quitsies.
4256,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Anti-quitsies. You're it. Quitsies. No anti-quitsies. No startsies.
4257,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Damn, you're good, Harry. Hey, didn't I tell you this trip would be a blast?"
4258,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"See, I told you these country folks were friendly, Harry."
4259,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Refresh my memory on something, Lloyd: what exactly do we do when we get to Aspen?"
4260,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Well the first thing we do is take a good deep breath of that famous Aspenese air.
4261,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Fresh, huh?"
4262,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,The freshest. They say on any day of the week you can smell a moose-fart ten miles away.
4263,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Wow... talk about paradise. And after we're finished breathing, what next, Lloyd?"
4264,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Then we make a splash on the social scene.
4265,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Harry, look the golden arches. Pull over, I'm starving. CUT TO:"
4266,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Thanks.
4267,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,About this social scene how do you expect a couple mutts like us to make a splash in the land of pedigrees when we don't even have any money?
4268,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Look, once we drop the briefcase off to Mary, she'll be so grateful she'll plug us right into the party circuit. After that, we do a little of the ski"
4269,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Where'd you hear that?
4270,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Some bum down at unemployment.
4271,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I don't know, Lloyd."
4272,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,What's the matter?
4273,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Money does terrible things to people. I mean, we could lose our friendship."
4274,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Yeah? So?
4275,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Hey, wait a second. Hold everything."
4276,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,What?
4277,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Aren't you forgetting something?
4278,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Back at Mickey D's? A little matter you might've overlooked...?
4279,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,What?
4280,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,My change.
4281,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,I think this guy's in trouble. Why on't you pull over.
4282,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,It's a fruit.
4283,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,It's a vegetable.
4284,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I'm telling you, it's a fruit."
4285,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,And I happen to know it's a vegetable.
4286,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Tell you what, why don't we leet an impartial judge decide."
4287,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Fine with me.
4288,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Hey, Mr. Mentalino, settle our bet: Are jelly beans fruits or vegetables?"
4289,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Okay, Harry, my turn. Let 'er rip."
4290,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Hmmm... full-bodied, delicate bouquet, aged to perfection will rip no fart before it's time. Come on, Marquis of Dingleberry's rules: you got ten seconds. All right. I'll say: cheese doodles, chili dog extra onions, garden salad with blue..."
4291,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,And...?
4292,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Kit-Kat bar.
4293,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"You're the best, man. Okay, my turn."
4294,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Where are your manners, Harry? We have a guest."
4295,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Come on, Mr. Mentalino. Let one fly. It's only a buck."
4296,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,I'll do one if you will.
4297,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Okay, you go first."
4298,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"No, you go first."
4299,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"No, you go first."
4300,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Hmmm, not bad..."
4301,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Yeah, more tingly than hot."
4302,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"That really wasn't very polite of him, was it? Maybe we should loosen the screws of his chair."
4303,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Harry Dunne, I'm surprised at you. Perhaps it's about time you brushed"
4304,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,You mean like 'turn the other cheek?'
4305,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"No, I mean like 'an eye for an eye.' Hand me those peppers the atomic ones."
4306,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Here he comes.
4307,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,More like re-location.
4308,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,The briefcase isn't even ours. Some lady just left it at the airport. We're bringing it back to her.
4309,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Not really. I was just her limo river.
4310,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Hey, you okay, man? It was just a goof."
4311,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,I can't believe it...
4312,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Life is a fragile thing, Har. One minute you're chewing on a burger; the next minute you're dead meat."
4313,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,But he blamed me. You heard him. Those were his last words.
4314,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,If you don't count that gurgling sound.
4315,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Hey, relax, man, I'm just as responsible as you are we both slipped him the peppers and look at me, I on't feel guilty at all."
4316,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Small comfort coming from a man who sells dead birds to blind kids. Don't you get it, Lloyd. I've got a ead guy pissed at me. His restless spirit will probably haunt me for the next seventy-five years."
4317,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,That's ridiculous. You probably won't live to see forty.
4318,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Oh yeah. Wow. What a relief.
4319,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Let's get off and crash at a motel before I crash into one. I need a crib fast.
4320,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Sorry, Har. We're gonna have to hold out. Seems we misjudged our expense allocation. If we pay for a motel we won't have enough for gas."
4321,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,What happened to the dough?
4322,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,We over-leveraged.
4323,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,On what?
4324,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I sprung for Mr. Chili Pepper's last meal. Felt it was the least we could o after we deep-sixed him.
4325,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Wait a second one burger put us over budget?
4326,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,The slob ordered a double-bacon eluxe and a chocolate malt.
4327,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Oh. So what are we gonna do?
4328,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Drive. We've only got ten more hours. We can take turns.
4329,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Come on, wake up. You pay, I'll pump."
4330,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Skis, huh?"
4331,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Great.
4332,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,They yours?
4333,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Both of 'em?
4334,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Cool.
4335,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,That's a lot of luggage for a little vacation.
4336,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Here, this is a little loose."
4337,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Allow me...
4338,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Look, um, maybe when I get to Aspen we can meet up... you know, for hot chocolate or something."
4339,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Look, why don't you just tell it to me, I've got a good memory."
4340,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Positive please hurry.
4341,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Um, yeah could you do it the other way around?"
4342,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"You've got some serious explaining to o, young man."
4343,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Look, Harry, I told you what happened, now drop it."
4344,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Sure thing, Lloyd. I promise not to mention another word about you being in a bathroom stall with a six-foot, five-inch trucker with his pants own."
4345,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"That's a low blow, man."
4346,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Not at that height it's not.
4347,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Listen, bud, if you're trying to imply that I'm that thought look, we're almost in Colorado."
4348,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,I think it's about time we pull over and change seats. I've been driving for nine straight hours I don't have the energy to start a new state.
4349,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Hey, I picked you up a Beef Jerky..."
4350,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Boy, some guys just weren't cut out for life on the road."
4351,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Hey, Mr. Sleepy Head, welcome back."
4352,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,How long have I been out?
4353,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"I'd say a good five hours, anyway."
4354,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Great. We must be getting real close, huh?"
4355,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Should be. I've been averaging about ninety miles an hour all night.
4356,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Good man.
4357,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Boy, I'll tell you, this is one angerous highway. You wouldn't believe all the road pizza two dead ogs, a couple of rabbits, a snake and some big thing I couldn't even recognize."
4358,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,That's awful. Did you see them get hit or were they already lying there?
4359,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I hit 'em.
4360,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Funny. I expected the Rocky Mountains to be a little rockier than this.
4361,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"I was thinking the same thing. That John Denver's some full of shit, huh?"
4362,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"I must say, Des Moines sure is a pretty little town."
4363,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Yeah, it really is. Wait a minute when did you visit Des Moines?"
4364,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Last night. We drove through it.
4365,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,What are you talking about? You were snoring like a baby when we went through Des Moines.
4366,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Rise and shine. You were the one who was asleep,"
4367,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Uh, Lloyd, refresh my memory: Doesn't the sun rise in the east and set in the west?"
4368,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"In our country it does, yes."
4369,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Then perchance you can explain to me why the sun is in our face at 7:30 in the morning when we're heading west.
4370,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"I'm only human, Harry. Anybody can make a mistake."
4371,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Come on, man, pull yourself together."
4372,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"You know, I got half a mind to just jump on the bus to Europe and say goodbye to your ugly mug forever."
4373,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"You can't take a bus to Europe, dodo."
4374,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Oh yeah? Why not?
4375,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,You don't have a passport.
4376,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Come on, stop being a baby about this. Okay, so we back-tracked a tad."
4377,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"A tad? Lloyd, you drove almost a sixth of the way across the country in the wrong direction. Now we don't have enough money to get to Aspen, we on't have enough money to get home, we don't have enough to eat, we don't have enough to sleep!"
4378,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Well it doesn't do any good having you sitting there on your butt whining about it. If we're gonna get out of this hole, we're gonna have to dig ourselves out."
4379,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"You know, you're absolutely right, Lloyd."
4380,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Where you going?
4381,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Home. I'm walking home.
4382,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,You can't be serious.
4383,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Why not? We're probably only five miles away.
4384,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Thanks a lot, Mr. Perfect. Like you never screwed up. Harry suddenly STOPS IN HIS TRACKS and turns back to his friend. He seems completely rained."
4385,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Look, man... I'm sorry. I never should have let you talk me into this in the first place. You've got a good reason to goo a beautiful girl's waiting for you. But let's face it, Lloyd, there's nothing waiting for me in Aspen. There's nothing waiting for me anywhere."
4386,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Got room for one more, if you still want to go to Aspen."
4387,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Where'd you find this baby?
4388,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Used car dealer. I traded the van for it. Plus I got the guy to throw in fifty bucks for gas money. Come on, man, what do you say? We still partners?"
4389,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Tell me something, Harry. Would you really have kept going home if I hadn't come back to get you?"
4390,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Well let me put it this way, Lloyd: Do you remember when we were Cub Scouts and we got lost in the woods uring that blizzard? We huddled together all night, and we made an oath that if we ever got out of there alive we'd never ever leave each other's side again. Do you remember that?"
4391,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,We were never Cub Scouts.
4392,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Exactly.
4393,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,What the hell is this? There's a coffin in the back!
4394,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Relax, it's empty."
4395,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,I don't give a shit. I'm not driving anywhere with a casket. You know I'm superstitious calm down. We'll dump it off first chance we get.
4396,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Isn't this wonderful? What more could a couple of single guys like us ask for?
4397,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,How about food and shelter?
4398,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"You're so materialistic. Why don't we get down to business and eliver the briefcase to Mary. Who knows, maybe she'll invite us in for tea and a strumpet or two?"
4399,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Jolly good idea, chap. And where oes the lovely young lady reside?"
4400,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Um... good question.
4401,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Well what's her last name? We'll look it up in the phone book.
4402,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Hmmmm... You know, I don't believe I caught that either."
4403,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"What about the briefcase, Lloyd? There must've been a name on it, right?"
4404,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Come to think of it, there is. It's engraved right into the leather."
4405,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,What is it?
4406,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Samsonite spelled just like it sounds.
4407,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Any soup left?
4408,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,A little. Shall we share it?
4409,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Please.
4410,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Mmmm mmmm good...
4411,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Hey, you got something stuck in your front teeth. Lloyd picks a small speck out of his mouth and studies it."
4412,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Hmmm... looks like an old piece of Beef Jerky.
4413,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Wanna split it?
4414,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,You're pathetic. Get your own.
4415,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I'm freezing my ass off, Lloyd."
4416,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Roll up your window.
4417,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,It is rolled up.
4418,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Then I guess the damn anti-cold system isn't working. You really should get it fixed if we're gonna live here all winter.
4419,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,What anti-cold system?
4420,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Right here the A/C button. I put it on full blast about an hour ago and, if anything, the car's getting colder."
4421,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,What are you going out there for?
4422,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,To warm up.
4423,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,What are you worrying about now?
4424,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,I'm worried about how you're gonna survive the pummeling I'm about to give you.
4425,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Huh?
4426,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Harry, calm down! You're acting like a wild animal!"
4427,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Get over here and take your medicine, Lloyd!"
4428,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Sorry, doc, I can't take medicine. I'm a Christian Scientist!"
4429,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,What are you doing?
4430,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Something I should've done a long time ago. This stupid thing has been the root of our problems all along.
4431,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Don't do anything foolish, Harry."
4432,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Foolish? This is the most sensible thing I've done in years. I'm gonna toss this goddamn curse right into that river. Lloyd starts to follow after Harry.
4433,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"You're making a big mistake, Harry! I'll never forgive you for this!"
4434,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Harry, hold up! Things are gonna get better, I promise! In fact, I think"
4435,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,You're bluffing.
4436,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"No I'm not, man look."
4437,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"That's a filling, you liar!"
4438,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I used to have a life! A miserable one, but a life, nonetheless!"
4439,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Harry, look!"
4440,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Okay, here's the plan: We borrow a few bucks just a small loan from the briefcase, and we check into a cheap motel."
4441,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Sounds good.
4442,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,And we'll keep track of the money we spend with IOUs.
4443,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,We'll be meticulous right down to the last penny.
4444,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"That way, whatever we borrow we can pay back."
4445,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Absolutely. We're good for it.
4446,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"You know, as soon as we get jobs."
4447,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,It'll come right out of our first paycheck.
4448,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Thanks, Barnard, but we'll find our own chicks."
4449,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Oh. Then go ahead and send thim up. What are their names?
4450,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Tell you what you can send up, my friend how about some chow?"
4451,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Don't bother. Just order us one of everything.
4452,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,One of everything? Lloyd...
4453,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Oh, sorry. Make that two of everything. Harry smiles at this as Lloyd pulls a wad of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS out of his pocket. He rips one off and tucks it in Barnard's top pocket."
4454,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"And here you go, Barney. You keep us happy, we'll keep you happy."
4455,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Our first IOU. Signed and dated.
4456,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Thank you.
4457,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"Yech! What's in this, whiskey?"
4458,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"Just knowing that Melvin's out there, being held by God knows who... It's all my fault. I should've been there."
4459,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Maybe we should just pay them the money again and get this thing over
4460,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,What am I supposed to do? Go about my life as if everything were fine?
4461,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Oh god, it's really true. Last night I thought I might've been dreaming."
4462,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"It's no dream, Har. We finally cracked the big time."
4463,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,And it was so simple. All it took was somebody else's money.
4464,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"You know, Lloyd, I think you might've gone a little overboard with the spending today."
4465,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"What's the big deal? We're gonna pay it all back anyway, right?"
4466,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Sure, but do you really think you needed to buy those two surfboards?"
4467,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Surfboards? I thought those were beginner's skis. This suddenly makes sense to Harry.
4468,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Ahhh. I was wondering why you had those bindings put on them.
4469,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Where'd this come from?
4470,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,I bought it.
4471,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,What for?
4472,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I like the feel of it against my skin... ...I mean, you know, when a woman's wearing it."
4473,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Harry, how many women do you know who wear a size XXL?"
4474,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Look, leave me alone. I'm rich now. I'm supposed to have a few eccentricities."
4475,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Enter, parlez vous!"
4476,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"All out of Boone's Farm, huh?"
4477,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh?"
4478,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Oh, one more thing: You can dispense with the 'sir' crap. Let's face it, Barney, we're all from the same mold. We just have a little more dough than you right now."
4479,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Cocktail hour has commenced!
4480,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Hey, later on what do you say we...?"
4481,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Lloyd... you okay?
4482,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Harry, it's her."
4483,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Who?
4484,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Mary with the briefcase. This is her...
4485,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Mary Swanson...
4486,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Come on, Cinderella, it's time to get you ready for the ball..."
4487,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Thanks for the lift, Barney."
4488,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,This should cover a couple plates.
4489,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I'm kind of hungry, Lloyd. What if we want seconds?"
4490,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Put us down for four plates, my good man."
4491,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"I'm getting nervous, Harry."
4492,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"relax, Lloyd. These people are just like you and me."
4493,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"What are you talking about? They're educated, well-bred, charming, and sophisticated."
4494,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"So what? We can be sophistica holy shit, would you look at the fun bags on that hose hound."
4495,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Don't do this to me, Harry. I'm already a wreck. What if Mary oesn't like me?"
4496,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Look, let's just go saddle up to the bar and down a couple bowls of loudmouth soup. A little booze'll bring back that old Lloyd Christmas over-confidence."
4497,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Two martinis, straight up. As Harry and Lloyd silently take in the party, a BEAUTIFUL RED HEAD reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then walks away."
4498,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Shut up, Harry."
4499,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,I didn't say anything.
4500,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Yeah, well I know what you were gonna say and I'm telling you to shut up in advance."
4501,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,How do you know what I was gonna say?
4502,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I read you like a book.
4503,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Okay, if you read me like a book then what was I gonna say?"
4504,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,You were gonna say: (in Harry's looped
4505,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"And I would say 'shut up', because this is our chance to get in with the rich and powerful and you don't ingratiate yourself to the kind of people by acting like Ron Jeremy on Spanish Fly."
4506,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Two more, please."
4507,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Lloyd, I've never seen you this uptight. You've gotta chill out."
4508,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I can't help it. This is a very important night for me.
4509,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Harry, have you ever wondered why you and I never have long-term girlfriends?"
4510,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,What are you talking about? I went out with Fraida Felcher for two and a half weeks.
4511,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,That was a fluke. The reason we never have long-term girlfriends is because of one thing: We're afraid of the C word.
4512,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,That's crazy. We live for the C word.
4513,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I'm talking bout commitment.
4514,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Oh.
4515,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Well I'm ready for commitment, Harry. The first time I laid eyes on Mary Swanson, I knew she was the one. Some things you feel in your heart, other things you feel in your groin. This girl makes me feel it all in the heart."
4516,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Oh shit, there she is."
4517,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Wow. You weren't kidding, Lloyd. She's an angel. Well, what are you waiting for? Get over there and talk to her."
4518,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,She's gonna think I'm some kind of psycho when she realizes how far I came just to see her.
4519,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,You have her briefcase she's gonna be thrilled to see you.
4520,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,And then what? She'll take it back and that'll be it. I'm a nobody.
4521,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Look, man, you just drove two thousand miles to see this girl. Don't quit on the last fifty feet."
4522,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Wait a second, I have an idea. You go over and introduce yourself. That way you can build me up so when I come along I won't have to brag about myself. Tell her I'm good-looking and I'm rich and I have a rapist's wit."
4523,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I can't tell her you're good looking, Lloyd she's got eyes."
4524,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Please Harry, I'm appealing to you as one loser to another. Just build me up and then give me a signal to come over. Please."
4525,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,All right. But you're gonna owe me a big one for this.
4526,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Nice set of hooters you got there.
4527,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,I beg your pardon?
4528,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,The owls. They're beautiful.
4529,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Oh. Yeah. Are you a bird lover?
4530,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Well, I used to have a parakeet, but my main area of expertise is canines that's dogs to the layperson."
4531,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"Thanks. I love dogs, too. So how"
4532,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Oh, I've trained them, bathed them, clipped them; I've even bred them."
4533,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Really? Any unusual breeding?
4534,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Nah, mostly just doggie-style. But one time we successfully mated a Bulldog and a Shitzu."
4535,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Really? That's weird.
4536,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Yeah. We called it a Bullshit. Just a little breeder joke.
4537,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Anyway, the real reason I came over is because I want to introduce you to a friend of mine."
4538,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"Actually, we haven't been introduced yet. I'm Mary Swanson, and this is my stepmother, Helen."
4539,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Harry Dunne. Pleasure meeting you both.
4540,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,You were?
4541,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Really?
4542,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Anyway, about my friend you doing anything tomorrow, Mr. Dunne? Because I believe Mary's looking for somebody to hit the slopes with. Whuh?"
4543,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"Helen, you're embarrassing me."
4544,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Oh, I don't know. You see, my friend your friends for one day. You and Mary will have a ball."
4545,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Um... well... I don't know. You see, the thing is... sure."
4546,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,How come you didn't call me over?
4547,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Relax, you're golden. I got you a ate with her tomorrow."
4548,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Wha... you... I... it's... I love you, man. I love you!"
4549,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Okay, get a grip, Lloyd. You're making a scene."
4550,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,This calls for a toast!
4551,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"You're gonna be my best man, Har, I mean it. It was always between you and my future wife's brother, but you just earned a seat at the head table, pal."
4552,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I think we've done enough hobnobbing, Lloyd."
4553,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Mrs. Christmas... Mary Christmas... Mrs. Mary Christmas. You
4554,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Sounds nice, Lloyd, but don't you think you may be jumping the gun a little? I mean, who knows, when you get to know her, you may find out she's not your type."
4555,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Impossible. I know my type when I see it. Now let me get this straight, she wants me to meet her at the Avalanche Bar and Grill on Main Street?"
4556,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,That's what she said. Ten o'clock sharp.
4557,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Time out. Where are going ressed like that.
4558,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I, uh, thought while you were making your love connection I'd try my luck on the slopes."
4559,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,You mean you're gonna go out in public dressed in tights?
4560,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,These aren't tights. They're fashionable Euro-trash ski trousers.
4561,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,But you can see the outline of your who-who.
4562,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Really?
4563,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Turn sideways.
4564,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Actually, it's just a tiny little lump. No one will ever notice."
4565,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,You're right. I can't go out dressed like this.
4566,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Sorry I'm late. It's a bitch driving a clutch with these things.
4567,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,You take the first run alone. I'm gonna loosen up down here.
4568,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I'm meeting someone. Mind if I wait at the bar?
4569,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"Beautiful day, huh, Harry?"
4570,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Glorious.
4571,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"God, it feels so good to get up here. I haven't been outdoors much in the last couple of weeks."
4572,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Why not?
4573,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,There's been... family problems. I on't want to bore you with them.
4574,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Thanks.
4575,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Oh, look... frost."
4576,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Are you okay?
4577,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Sure. I do this all the time... CUT TO:
4578,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,See ya at the bottom...
4579,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Hi. Say, kids, you wouldn't happen to have a cup of warm water, would you?"
4580,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"My god. Harry, are you okay?"
4581,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I'm fine, I'm fine. It'll come off."
4582,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,This is silly. Let me help you...
4583,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Maybe some other time.
4584,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to know a Mary Swanson, would you?"
4585,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Do you know where she lives?
4586,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"I've got to tell you, today was really just what I needed. Thanks a lot, Harry."
4587,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"My pleasure, Mary."
4588,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,So you'll pick me up tonight at 7:45?
4589,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Better make it quarter to eight. I've got a few things to take care of first.
4590,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Mary Dunne... Mrs. Mary Dunne... Got a nice ring to it.
4591,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Some best man.
4592,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"It doesn't make any sense, Lloyd. She told me ten o'clock sharp. Are you sure you went to the right bar?"
4593,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Believe me, it was the right place. I don't know, Har, maybe she just had second thoughts."
4594,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"I have a hard time believing that, Lloyd. The girl said she couldn't wait to see you again."
4595,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Wait a minute...
4596,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,What?
4597,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,It just occurred to me. She must've meant ten o'clock at night.
4598,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Do ya think...?
4599,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Of course! Why would she have you meet her at a bar at ten in the morning?
4600,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I just figured she was a raging alcoholic.
4601,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Boy, aren't we a couple of beauties?"
4602,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I knew there was an explanation. And here I thought she was standing me up.
4603,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"That'll teach you to jump to conclusions. Anyway, since you have your night all"
4604,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Will you join me in a good luck toast before you head out?
4605,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Sure thing, pal. Whatever you think will help your chances."
4606,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Pretty snazzed out for a movie, aren't you?"
4607,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Uh... it's for mature audiences. I on't wanna chance getting turned away at the door.
4608,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I see.
4609,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,To my friend Harry the matchmaker.
4610,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Mmmmm...
4611,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Hi. Come on in.
4612,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Make yourself at home. I'm almost ready. Just give me one more minute.
4613,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"Are you in there, Harry?"
4614,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Be right out.
4615,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,I hope you're not using the toilet. It's broken.
4616,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Huh?
4617,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,It doesn't flush.
4618,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Um, no, I was just... shaving."
4619,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Shaving?
4620,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Yeah! I was running a little late. Thought this would save time.
4621,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Okay. Well I'll be in the living room whenever you're ready.
4622,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Come on, flush, you bastard..."
4623,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Yes...?
4624,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Hi. Don't you remember me?
4625,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Um... I'm not really...
4626,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,South Bend. I drove you to the airport last week.
4627,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"Oh my god. Lloyd, right?"
4628,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,You remembered.
4629,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,What are you doing in Aspen?
4630,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I brought you your briefcase You left it at the airport so I picked it up for you.
4631,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,You're the one who took my briefcase?
4632,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Yeah, it's back at my hotel room. Come on, let's take a ride. I'll give it to you."
4633,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Wait right here.
4634,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"Harry, what are you doing in there?"
4635,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Uh... just cleaning my teeth. Give me a minute, Mary, I'll be right with you."
4636,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"Sorry, but something important's come up and I have to run out. It's sort of an emergency. I'll explain later."
4637,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,But Mary --
4638,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"--I'm really sorry, Harry. I promise we'll do this another time."
4639,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Great...
4640,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"..So anyway, as soon as I got to town I tried to look you up but I idn't know your last name."
4641,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,I don't believe it. You really have it.
4642,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"'Course I have it. When Lloyd Christmas drives a woman to the airport, he makes sure she gets all her luggage, no matter what he has to"
4643,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,This is incredible. You mean to say you drove two thousand miles just for me?
4644,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Well... no... I mean, you know, there were other reasons... Actually, yeah, I guess I did."
4645,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,That is the sweetest thing I've ever heard.
4646,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"It's all Kharma, Harry. You screw your best friend over and it's gonna come back to haunt you, plain and simple..."
4647,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Look, Mary, I know this may seem a little sudden but I've given it a lot of thought: You're the woman I've been waiting for my whole life, and I'm not ashamed to admit it -- --Please, let me finish. I'm crazy about you. I've never felt this way about anyone. You make it so easy for me to tell you my innermost desires. Listen to me, I feel like a schoolboy again. A schoolboy who desperately wants to make sweet, sweet love to you."
4648,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Oh... I thought I heard you talking to someone.
4649,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Mary... I desperately want to make love to a schoolboy.
4650,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Maybe I should be going now.
4651,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"No, that's not what Imeant. I meant... I really like you, Mary. I like you a lot."
4652,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I'm gonna ask you something flat out and I want you to answer me honestly: What do you think the chances are of a girl like you and a guy like me ending up together?
4653,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"Lloyd, that's difficult to say. I"
4654,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"--I asked you to be honest, Mary."
4655,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"But Lloyd, I really can't --"
4656,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"--Come on, give it to me straight. I rove a long way to see you, the least you can do is level with me. What are my chances?"
4657,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Not good.
4658,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"You mean not good, like one out of a hundred?"
4659,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,I'd say more like one out of a million.
4660,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,So you're telling me there's a chance?
4661,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,Nicholas... what are you doing here?
4662,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Husband?
4663,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,You...? What are you doing here?
4664,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Who are you?
4665,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Uh-oh.
4666,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"Nicholas, you... you motherfucker! My family trusted you!"
4667,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Uh, sir, about the briefcase, I want you to know, my friend Harry and I have every intention of reimbursing you."
4668,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"That's as good as money, sir. Those are our IOUs. You can add them up yourself. Every penny's accounted for."
4669,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Now don't do anything hasty, man."
4670,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Lloyd, are you home? We've gotta talk, man. I have a serious confession to make."
4671,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Oh good, you found her. I'll just leave you two kids alone."
4672,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,You mean you two know each other?
4673,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Yeah, we used to be best friends."
4674,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Until he turned into a backstabber.
4675,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Me a backstabber? You got a lot of nerve. I saw her first.
4676,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Hey, I couldn't help it if she found me irresistable."
4677,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,But you knew how crazy I was about her.
4678,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Yeah, and you knew how crazy I was about Fraida Felcher, but that didn't stop you, did it?"
4679,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,What are you talking about?
4680,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Don't deny it, Lloyd. Fraida told me the whole sordid story."
4681,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Look... I was gonna tell you about that. It was gonna be mentioned at the reading of my will. I swear, you can ask my lawyer."
4682,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Well I guess we both learned a little something about each other, didn't we?"
4683,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"You said it, pal. Maybe we're not as good friends as we thought we were."
4684,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Guess not.
4685,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"I mean, if one beautiful girl could rip us apart like this, then it seems our friendship isn't worth a damn. Maybe we should call it quits right here."
4686,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Just tell me where to sign, bud."
4687,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,I wouldn't pull that trigger if I were you.
4688,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Except you're forgetting one minor etail.
4689,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"If you kill us, you'd be killing yourself."
4690,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"You see, philosophers believe that we're all really just tiny pieces of one huge universal being. In other words, I am you and you are me, so if you were to kill us you'd be committing suicide, you unenlightened"
4691,Dumb-and-Dumber,MARY,"What about my husband? Did you kill him, too?"
4692,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Husband? What husband?
4693,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Mary's married, Harry."
4694,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Kill her. The bitch should've told him she was married back at the airport. It would've saved us a lot of trouble.
4695,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"No, I'll go first, Harry. I was the one who got you into this mess."
4696,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"No, wait, do me first. I'm the one who stole your girl, Lloyd. I eserve it."
4697,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Jesus Christ! You killed my best friend, you bastard!"
4698,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,Harry! You're alive!
4699,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,You gotta be kidding.
4700,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,She grabbed me down in the lobby and explained what was up. They slapped this on me and gave me a gun.
4701,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,But how did you...?
4702,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Yeah, about that dough..."
4703,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"She's something, ain't she, Har?"
4704,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"You were right, Lloyd. She was efinitely worth the trip."
4705,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Guess we have to admit it, she was too good for us."
4706,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Hey, Barney..."
4707,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Look, we just wanted to say that we appreciate all you did for us during our stay."
4708,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"And we're, um, sorry about the money we gave you turning out to be phony."
4709,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"Well, anyway, thanks again for everything."
4710,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,I dunno. I'm sure we'll find a trailer camp somewhere to call home.
4711,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"This joint is a little out of our budget, Barney."
4712,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Are you on the level?
4713,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,"You know what, Barney, I think we'll take out chances down the road."
4714,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,"Since we're finished elbow-rubbing, what next, lloyd?"
4715,Dumb-and-Dumber,LLOYD,I say we head due south and try a little nose-rubbing with some of them slinky eskimo babes.
4716,Dumb-and-Dumber,HARRY,Now you're talking my language. You know I got a weakness for blondes.
4717,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,What'd the doctor say?
4718,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Should we take the short cut or the scenic route?
4719,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,But the scenic route is so much prettier.
4720,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Great. It's actually slightly quicker, anyway. Fox throws his apple core away over his shoulder and dances a quick circle around Mrs. Fox, wrapping his arm around her waist extravagantly and making her laugh as they start off down the scenic route."
4721,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"You know what a squab is. It's like a pigeon, I suppose. Anyway, it's a type of bird we can eat. Fox motions toward the edge of the property."
4722,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Should we go through the hole under the horse fence or climb the rail over the bridle path?
4723,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,But the bridle path puts us out right next to the squab shack. Mrs. Fox hesitates. She fiddles with her paws. She nods nervously. She shakes slightly. Fox looks at her funny.
4724,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,What's wrong? I've never seen you like this. You're acting all skittish. Don't worry. I've been stealing birds for a living since before I could trot.
4725,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"No, we'll do the horse fence. You gave me the scenic route already. Fox flashes a smile. He says suddenly:"
4726,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"By the way, you look unbelievably beautiful tonight. You're practically glowing. Maybe it's the lighting."
4727,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,What's that? I think that's a fox-trap! Look at this.
4728,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Is it spring-loaded? Yeah... I guess if you come from over there, and you're standing at the door to the squab shack, this little gadget probably triggers the -- Move out of the way, darling. That's right where it's going to land. Mrs. Fox runs back to Fox and tugs at his arm."
4729,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"No, it just falls straight down right here, doesn't it? I guess it's not spring- loaded. Sounds come from around the farm: the dog barks, doors open, voices yell, lights come on. Mrs. Fox turns to Fox and says"
4730,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Wow. We're going to have a cub. Honey, that's great news!"
4731,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Does anybody actually read my column? Do your friends ever talk about it?
4732,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Why would they? It's a rag-sheet.
4733,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,I love the way you handled that. Mrs. Fox looks at Fox sideways. She says loudly to Ash:
4734,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Dad's study is occupied by Dad. Ash goes back into his bedroom. Fox lowers his newspaper. He looks around the room. He says to Mrs. Fox:
4735,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,I don't want to live in a hole anymore. It makes me feel poor. Mrs. Fox stops buttering the toast. She looks to Fox and says
4736,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Comme-ci, comme-ga. Anyway, the views are better above ground. Mrs. Fox nods. She brings Fox a plate of toast and a cup of coffee. Fox takes her paw and says:"
4737,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I'm seven non-fox-years old now. My father died at seven and a half. I don't want to live in a hole anymore, and I'm going to do something about it. Fox kisses Mrs. Fox's paw. He suddenly eats three slices of toast in a second and a half, savagely but neatly. He stands and picks up his cup of coffee."
4738,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Well, I'm off. Fox throws back the last of his coffee, kisses Mrs. Fox on the back of her neck, grabs his briefcase, tucks his newspaper under his arm, and walks to the door. He shouts"
4739,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Have a good day, my darlings! Ash comes out the bedroom again. He has now added a white cape to his ensemble and is in the middle of brushing his teeth. There is toothpaste all over his mouth. He waves briefly to Fox and goes back into his bedroom. Fox looks puzzled."
4740,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,What's he wearing? Mrs. Fox shrugs. She smiles sadly and waves to Fox. Fox waves back. He starts to go out but pauses to look down at a folded up section of his newspaper.
4741,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"What's in the bucket, Mr. Kylie?"
4742,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Certainly. Thank you. Kylie reaches into his bucket and hands Fox a live, wriggling minnow. Fox swallows it whole. Fox stares out the window at three sprawling poultry compounds in the distance. Black smoke pours out of a farmhouse chimney on each property. A sign on a water tower in the first compound reads Boggis Farms and has a picture of a chicken on it. A sign on a silo in the second compound reads Bunce Industries and has a picture of a goose on it. A sign on a windmill in the third compound reads Bean, inc."
4743,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I used to steal birds, but now I'm a newspaper man."
4744,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Good afternoon, gentlemen. Fox shakes hands abruptly with Weasel and starts across the room. Weasel is about to ask something when Fox stops in the doorway, looks back, and says:"
4745,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Oh, and Kylie -- thank you for the minnow. It was superb. Kylie smiles. Fox exits."
4746,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"You're exaggerating, Badger."
4747,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Really? Tell me about them. Silence. Badger sighs. He loosens his tie and settles in.
4748,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I understand what you're saying, and your comments are valuable, but I'm going to ignore your advice. Badger leaps out of his chair and slams the office door. He points his finger at Fox and screams:"
4749,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Don't cussing point at me!
4750,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,One last thing: something's probably about to happen to me at work which I can't put my finger on but have a funny feeling about. How can I protect myself legally?
4751,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Slash I quit. Here's my letter of resignation. Fox's silhouette throws an envelope onto the squirrel's desk.
4752,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Good jump, Ash! Remember to keep your tail tucked! Fox looks at Mrs. Fox's canvas. It is a picture of the pond and landscape in severe weather with black clouds and lightning bolts. It is signed Felicity Fox. Fox raises an eyebrow."
4753,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Still painting thunderstorms, I see. Fox sees a small, Samsonite suitcase on the ground next to a pair of yellow sneakers. He frowns."
4754,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Whose suitcase is that? A boy's voice shouts from the high tree branch:
4755,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Kristofferson! Welcome to our little tree! I see you brought your swimming trunks! Kristofferson steps off the branch and performs a reserved but perfect jack-knife. He enters the water splashlessly. Fox leaps to his feet, applauding with his paws above his head, whistling and hollering:"
4756,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Look at that! This kid's a natural! I'm speechless, Kristofferson! Kristofferson smiles modestly and shrugs. Ash stares at him stonily. Fox turns to Mrs. Fox."
4757,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Plus, he knows karate."
4758,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,What are you talking about?
4759,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,What's the sub-text here? Ash thinks for a minute. He looks at Kristofferson in the next room. Kristofferson is now sitting Indian-style on the floor meditating. His paws are turned upward with his thumbs touching his index fingers forming a ring. Ash says loudly to Mrs. Fox in the kitchen:
4760,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Kids are crazy, aren't they? You got to try it, though. Raising a family."
4761,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"What do you think of this tree, by the way? It's great, huh?"
4762,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,I have one last part of what I was about to say.
4763,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,I'm going broke. You want to help me steal some chickens?
4764,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I used to do this professionally, and I was very successful at it. I had to get out of it for personal reasons, but I've decided to secretly quit my job slash got fired to pursue it again. I'm bringing you in as my secretary and personal assistant."
4765,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I'm going totape this formyrecords,so don't make a lot of sounds --meaning stop rocking."
4766,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I don't want people to eavesdrop on us, Kylie. Let me just tell this. Kylie stops rocking. Fox presses record on a tape recorder."
4767,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Master Plan. Phase one. Side A.
4768,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,We'll start with Boggis' Chicken House #1. His only security is a few old hunting beagles and a low stone wall. Now a word about beagles: never look a beagle directly in the eye. And if --
4769,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I picked some blueberries, butterflied them with a scalpel, and laced each one with ten milligrams of high-potency sleeping powder."
4770,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Enough to tranquilize a charging gorilla.
4771,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Beagles love blueberries.
4772,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"If we approach with the wind in our faces, we'll smell the chicken livers on Boggis' breath from at least fifty yards away."
4773,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Remember: they aren't very smart, but they're incredibly paranoid -- so always kill a chicken in one bite."
4774,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"One bite, get it? Fox waits for Kylie to respond. Kylie does not. Fox frowns."
4775,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Are you listening to me? I look into your eyes and I can't tell whether you're getting anything I'm saying. Kylie stares at Fox vacantly. He shrugs.
4776,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"A few beagles, as we discussed, but we're ready for that. Fox and Kylie cross a dirt lane and come out of a shallow ditch. Fox licks the pinky of his paw and holds it up in the air."
4777,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,You feel that? The wind's in our faces.
4778,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Oh, nothing? Never mind. Fox and Kylie veer off into shorter grasses. Fox points ahead, regaining his composure:"
4779,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Here comes the low stone wall. Not a problem. Fox and Kylie climb over a low stone wall and find themselves at the base of a chain-link fence eleven feet high.
4780,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"This is a chain-link fence, I guess. Did I not remember this? Maybe it's new. Let's pause."
4781,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Give me a second! I said, ""Let's pause""! Pause. Fox pulls himself together. He turns to look at the plywood lightning bolt."
4782,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"That, I guess, hypothetically, could mean maybe this fence might be electric."
4783,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Watch this. Fox puts a blueberry into the end of a straw and shoots it out into the barnyard.
4784,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Beagles love blueberries! Didn't I tell you? The master plan's working again! Kylie raises his fist enthusiastically and trips over an unconscious beagle. He picks himself up quickly, and they weave among the rest of the beagles. They reach the entrance to the chicken house, open the door, and duck inside. Pause. There is an eruption of crazed squawking, screaming, and fighting from inside. The chicken house rumbles. Lights jolt on across the compound. An alarm goes off. Voices yell. The chicken house door swings open again, and Fox and Kylie emerge among a cloud of feathers. Fox carries two dead chickens, and Kylie has one live one. Fox yells:"
4785,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I said one bite, cuss it!"
4786,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Follow me again! Fox and Kylie run back across the barnyard, past the beagles as they begin to wake up and stagger around. Farmhands appear, loading shotguns and running into the confusion. Fox and Kylie race by, unnoticed, among them. They dart into the house through a flap in the back door. The lights are out in the kitchen. They take a moment, breathing hard in the darkness. Kylie shakes his head in disbelief."
4787,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Yeah.
4788,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I have no idea. Fox opens the door-flap a crack. He looks out and sees Boggis opening the front gate to let out his beagles and farmhands, barking and shooting, as they search for the intruders. Fox shouts to Kylie:"
4789,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Holy cuss! They opened the gate! Follow me again! Lightning quick, Fox and Kylie burst out through the door- flap, race across the barnyard, and dart through the open gate. Up the road, Boggis screams furiously as he runs with his pack of beagles and farmhands. Fox and Kylie fly into the bushes. As they race through the underbrush Fox says"
4790,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Let's hit the five and dime on the way home! We need to make some fake price tags and wrap these chickens in wax-paper so it looks like we got them at the butcher shop! Fox and Kylie howl ecstatically.
4791,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I'm supposed to cover this book party at some animal's nest in a tobacco field down the hill, so me and Kylie are going to hop over there and give it a whirl. Don't wait up. Fox pulls his napkin out of his collar, drops it on the table, and stands up. Mrs. Fox asks cooly:"
4792,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Dinner was -- -- pitch-perfect.
4793,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,I spotted a couple of broken burglar bars underneath the back door to Bean's secret cider cellar.
4794,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Where'd you come from? Go back to the tree and do your homework!
4795,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,But nothing! You're going to get me in a lot of trouble! The three animals stand in silence for a minute. Fox points to his tree. Ash turns and starts back home. Fox shakes his head.
4796,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Where the cuss does that kid get off? Can you believe that? How'd he get tipped off? You think he's going to tell on us? Fox turns to Kylie. Kylie looks back at him vacantly.
4797,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Before we go any further, from now on can you give me some kind of signal once in a while just so I know any of this is getting through to you? Pause. Kylie makes a slight motion with his paw. Fox hesitates."
4798,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Was that it? OK.
4799,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"You've aged badly, Rat."
4800,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Do you refer to my wife?
4801,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Shut up. Rat lunges at Fox with his switchblade. Fox dodges nimbly. He cocks an eyebrow and smiles:
4802,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"That was close, Rat. Be careful."
4803,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Woah! I didn't see you. Sitting in the dark over there. Yeah, no. Actually, there's a fire. I just got the call. They said maybe it's arson? I got to interview the marshall and see what's --"
4804,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Nice job covering for me. Next time
4805,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"All three! Fox and Kylie spin around and dart back into the hole as Boggis, Bunce, and Bean open fire wildly from the bushes. A barrage of bullets and buckshot rips into the tree-bark. Silence."
4806,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,What's with the crazy outfit? Why a cape and the pants tucked into your socks? Ash does not respond. Fox sighs. Mrs. Fox finishes bandaging his tail. Fox goes over to the wall and stands with his back to the room.
4807,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,I got fired slash quit the Gazette and started stealing chickens on the sly.
4808,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Why the cuss didn't I listen my lawyer? At this point we'll be lucky if we can flip this tree for half of what we've already sunk into it. Fox flips over onto his stomach.
4809,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,I won't be able to sleep on my back for six weeks -- and on my stomach I feel congested. Why the cuss didn't I listen to my lawyer?
4810,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,What was that?
4811,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Wake up! Everybody! They're digging us out! There is a scrunch and then a loud thump from above. Mrs. Fox looks at Fox intensely:
4812,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,I've got it! There's not a moment to lose! Why didn't I think of this before?
4813,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Think of the one thing a fox does quicker than a man, quicker than any other animal in the world!"
4814,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,I think it's time for me to give us a pep talk and explain some things. A very long time ago --
4815,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,One of those slovenly farmers is probably wearing my tail as a necktie by now.
4816,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,You scared the cuss out of us!
4817,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,You don't just bang into somebody's cussing tunnel!
4818,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,You're cussing right I'm cussing yelling!
4819,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Give me a minute. Fox turns and walks away. He faces the wall of the tunnel. He sits down on a rock. Everyone watches him uncertainly. They look at each other. Badger starts to say something, but Kylie cuts him off sharply:"
4820,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,I've got an idea.
4821,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,It could be a good one.
4822,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,It might save our lives.
4823,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,All right! Let's try it!
4824,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Go to the flint-mine. Tell Mrs. Badger, Rabbit's ex-girlfriend, et al. that help is on the way."
4825,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I sure as cuss hope so. Mrs. Fox detects a special, familiar, inspired light in her husband's eyes at this moment. She nods. She hands Ash the lantern. She straightens the neck-line of his cape, licks the mud off Ash's snout, and scrambles away down Badger's tunnel. Ash wants to cry but does not. Fox turns to the others."
4826,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Gentlemen, this time we must dig in a very special direction. Fox feels the walls with his paws. Everyone watches attentively."
4827,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,I got to kind of feel out the vibe. Fox stops. He points slightly downwards and due south. He says with quiet anticipation:
4828,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Begin. Everyone starts digging, slowly but intently."
4829,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I've done it! I've done it, first time! Come up and see where you are, my darlings! Everyone scrambles up out of the tunnel."
4830,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,I hit it slap in the middle! Do you get how incredible this is? The others nod. They look dazed and wild. Fox holds up his hands and whispers:
4831,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Don't lose your heads, now. Let's do this properly. First, everyone have a drink of water. Fox leads the others over to the chickens' drinking trough. They all lap up the cool water. Fox dries his mouth."
4832,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,But Clive's right --
4833,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I guess we do have those three ugly, cusshole farmers to thank for one thing: reminding us to be thankful and aware of each other. I'm going to say it again."
4834,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I've stepped on some toes and alienated a few of you over the past few days -- but is it wrong for me to suggest we might've done worse than having an incredible banquet in a beautiful flint-mine surrounded by our favorite animals? Look at each other. Here we are. Wow. Now I've already had too much to drink, and I'm feeling sentimental, but I'm going to say something, anyway, which nobody wants to admit, but I think is probably true: we beat 'em. We beat those farmers, and now we're triumphantly eating their roasted chicken, their sizzling duck, their succulent turkey, their foie gras de --"
4835,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Let's pause again. A wild deluge smashes into the room flooding the flint-mine and tunnels with a blasting current that sweeps everyone and everything away chaotically.
4836,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,What the cuss just happened? Something with water. That was dangerous. Is anyone hurt?
4837,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Let's do a head-count! Everybody pick a buddy! Each animal turns to his neighbor and establishes their buddy relationship. Fox looks wildly agitated as his eyes dart about, searching. He shouts:"
4838,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Where'd the boys go? Ash? Kristofferson? Ash's voice cracks on the other side of the cavern:
4839,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Ash! Who's your buddy?
4840,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,You lost him? Where were you?
4841,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Kristofferson! Fox sprints around the cavern, splashing, digging, and ducking in and out of tunnels as the others join his frantic search. His voice sounds pained as he shouts:"
4842,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Kristofferson! Kristofferson! Kristofferson!
4843,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Your brother's going to kill me, if he survives his double-pneumonia. Beaver runs into the brick cavern out of a drainpipe,"
4844,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Somebody take over. I'm not in charge anymore.
4845,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"You told me to change, but I can't --"
4846,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Excuse us, everyone. Fox leads Mrs. Fox over to a ledge near a cement waterfall on the far side of the brick cavern. He puts his arm around her waist."
4847,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Badger's right. These farmers aren't going to quit until they catch me. I shouldn't have lied to your face. I shouldn't have resigned slash gotten fired from the Gazette. I shouldn't have pushed these farmers so far and tried to embarrass them and cuss with their heads. I enjoyed it, but I shouldn't have done it -- and now there's only one way out. Maybe if I hand myself over and let them kill me, stuff me, and hang me over their"
4848,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I don't know, but I have a possible theory. I think I have this thing where I need everybody to think I'm the greatest -- the quote-unquote fantastic Mr. Fox -- and if they aren't completely knocked- out, dazzled, and kind of intimidated by me, then I don't feel good about myself. Mrs. Fox shakes her head and turns away. Fox continues:"
4849,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Foxes traditionally like to court danger, hunt prey, and outsmart predators -- and that's what I'm actually good at! I think, at the end of the day, I'm just --"
4850,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I guess we always were. I promise you: if I had all this to do over again, I'd have never let you down. It was always more fun when we did it together, anyway. Mrs. Fox has tears all over her face. Fox kisses her. He whispers in her ear:"
4851,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I love you, Felicity."
4852,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Did I ever tell you about the time I learned we were going to have a cub?
4853,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Right. We were at gun-point, and your"
4854,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Let me tell it, OK? I had no idea how we were going to get out of this jam, and then it hit me: what do foxes do better than any other animal?"
4855,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,You're stepping on my lines.
4856,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"So we dug. And the whole time I put paw over paw, scooping dirt and pebbles with your mother digging like crazy beside me, I kept wondering: who is this little boy going to be?"
4857,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Or girl, right -- because at that point we didn't know. Fox grabs Ash by his shoulders and looks him in the eye."
4858,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Ash, I'm so glad he was you. Fox hugs Ash tightly, holds him for an instant, then let's go. He turns to the group."
4859,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Badger, organize a search party and try to find Kristofferson. Maybe he's alive. I'm sorry, everyone. I wish --"
4860,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"All these wasted years. What were you looking for, Rat? Fox wipes the blood from Rat's chin. Rat mutters."
4861,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Here you are, Rat. A beaker of Bean's finest secret cider. Rat's slivery, scratchity, long, pink tongue laps up a taste of the black liquid. He licks his lips and says faintly:"
4862,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"But, in the end -- he's just another dead rat in a garbage pail behind a Chinese restaurant. Ash puts his hand on Fox's shoulder. Fox lays Rat gently onto the sewer floor. He stands up and turns to the rest of the group. Badger claps his paws together."
4863,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Just some old back-story.
4864,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"In a way, I'm almost glad that flood interrupted us, because I don't like the toast I was giving. I'm going to start over. Fox pantomimes raising a long-stemmed glass."
4865,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"When I look down this table with the exquisite feast set before us, I see: two terrific lawyers, a skilled pediatrician, a wonderful chef, a savvy real-estate agent, an excellent tailor, a crack accountant, a gifted musician, a pretty good minnow fisherman, and possibly the best landscape painter working on the scene today. As Fox describes them, the shot cuts to: Badger and Beaver; Mrs. Badger; Rabbit; Weasel; an especially small, waifish field mouse; Mole; Kylie ; and Mrs. Fox, respectively."
4866,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Maybe a few of you might even read my column from time to time. Who knows? I tend to doubt it.
4867,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Wild animals with true natures and pure talents. Wild animals with scientific- sounding Latin names that mean something about our D.N.A. Wild animals each with his own strengths and weaknesses due to his or her species, and also -- well, I guess these things usually have a lot to"
4868,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"do with the parents, as we all know. Anyway, I think it may very well be all the beautiful differences among us that just might give us the tiniest glimmer of a chance of saving my nephew and letting me make it up to you for getting us into this crazy whatever-it-is. I don't know. It's just a thought. Thank you for listening. Cheers, everyone. Fox motions with his imaginary glass and pantomimes drinking it. A few of the others reluctantly pantomime drinking. Fox finishes his glass and pantomimes throwing it on the floor. He makes a smashing-glass sound. Kylie shouts:"
4869,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Linda! Lutra Lutra! You got some dry paper? Here we go! Fox, highly energized, moves among the group, touching their shoulders and patting their backs."
4870,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Mole! Talpa Europea! What do you got?
4871,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Rabbit! Oryctolagus Cuniculus!
4872,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,You bet your cuss you are! Linda?
4873,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Beaver! Castor Fiber!
4874,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Amazing! Linda?
4875,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Badger! Meles Meles!
4876,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Demolitions expert! OK! Linda!
4877,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Weasel! Mustela Nivalis!
4878,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,All right! Fox points to the various cubs and pups.
4879,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,All you little kids get organized and put together some kind of a K.P. unit or something to keep this sewer clean. It's good for morale. The field mouse shoves his way to the front of the crowd. He makes a fist with his paw.
4880,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"You're a cuss of a lot bigger than you look, Rickity. Kylie tugs at Fox's sleeve. Fox turns to look at him. Kylie"
4881,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Listen, you're Kylie. You're an unbelievably nice guy. Your job is really just to... be available, I think. I don't know your Latin name. I doubt they even had opossums in ancient Rome. Kylie puts his hands in his pockets and scowls."
4882,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,It's stupendous. Where's us?
4883,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Paint an X.
4884,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Synchronize your clocks. The time is
4885,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,-- nine forty-five A.M. Everyone checks their watches. Badger points at Fox's wrist.
4886,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Did you bring the boy?
4887,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Come on! That doesn't sound anything like him! It's amateur night in Dixie! Badger rapidly slaps two pieces of flint together. A bit chips off, and sparks fly from the break. He blows on some kindling. He takes a pinecone out of a basket."
4888,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Scared, no! I have a phobia of them!"
4889,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Where'd you come from again? How'd you get in the sidecar? I feel like I'm losing my mind! Fox angrily steers toward a small mound of dirt. They jump it slightly and fly over a little ditch. Ash yelps enthusiastically as Fox drives them back onto the road.
4890,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,That's the annex over there on the right. Ash nods. Kylie does not respond.
4891,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,The white building over there on the right. Pause. Fox looks to Kylie.
4892,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Kylie? Kylie turns to Fox and stares at him vacantly. Fox says
4893,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Kylie!
4894,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"When? I didn't see it! Kylie makes his slight gesture with his paw. The gardener puts three turnips into a basket and rides away on his bicycle. Fox, Kylie, and Ash scramble down the tree trunk. They come out of the bushes on their motorcycle and ride through the gates, across the yard, past the wandering turkeys. They park outside the courtyard doors to Bean Annex and jump off the motorcycle."
4895,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Kylie, you got a credit card?"
4896,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,A Titanium Card? How the cuss did you qualify for this?
4897,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Give me a blueberry. Kylie looks surprised. He shrugs. He shakes his head and gestures, I don't have any. Fox frowns. He throws up his hands in the air. Kylie makes a frustrated face. Fox points at him. Kylie looks away and snorts angrily. Fox looks away and spits at the ground. Ash says quietly:"
4898,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,That's not soap.
4899,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,He's rabid. With rabies. I've heard about this beagle. The beagle stands up. Fox says carefully:
4900,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Easy, boy. Fox takes a cautious step toward the beagle. He holds out the back of his paw for the beagle to sniff. He says back over his shoulder to Kylie and Ash:"
4901,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I'm going to try to befriend him. I feel like there's a tenderness in his eyes. Fox takes another step. He makes a soft, kissing noise. The beagle watches him calmly."
4902,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Yes, I'm right. He's a good boy. A little lonely, maybe, but -- Fox takes another cautious step."
4903,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"-- but terribly sweet. Hello, there, boy. Is your name Spitz? That's German, isn't it?"
4904,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Climb the trellis! In well under a second, Fox, Kylie, and Ash scale the trellis six stories -- Kylie's pants catching on a nail and ripping off on the way up -- and find themselves standing on the roof of Bean Annex. Kylie wears blue Fruit-of-the-Looms with a pattern of stars, moons, and planets on them. They all look down at the rabid beagle, which continues to pitch an insane fit, running in circles after its tail at the bottom of the courtyard. Fox takes in their new surroundings. He says, pleased:"
4905,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"So the attic is probably in the area right up around here somewhere, I figure, huh? Kylie and Ash, panting and dripping with sweat, both stare at Fox vacantly."
4906,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Your tractors uprooted my tree. Your posse hunted my family. Your gunmen kidnapped my nephew. Your rat insulted my wife -- and you shot off my tail.
4907,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Ash, that was pure, wild animal craziness. You're an athlete. Ash swallows. He beams. He sits up straighter. Fox kick-starts the motorcycle and races across the farm. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean scramble onto the roof of a car port with an old, white Mercedes convertible under it. The snarling beagle barks and snaps below them. They watch as: Fox steers the motorcycle toward a broken apple cart at the edge of the property. He guns the motor and yells:"
4908,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Holy swearing cuss!!!
4909,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"What? Fox turns around. A huge, wild, grey wolf with ice-blue eyes stands on a rock fifty feet away from them. Fox slams on the brakes. The motorcycle slides to a halt."
4910,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Where'd he come from?
4911,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Canis lupus! Fox points to himself:
4912,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Vulpes Vulpes! The wolf does not answer. Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson watch idling from the motorcycle."
4913,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,I don't think he speaks English or Latin.
4914,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,He doesn't seem to know. Silence. Fox shouts to the wolf with a strange hitch in his
4915,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"I have a phobia of wolves! The wolf does not answer. It breathes heavily with its mouth open. Its teeth are long, sharp, and yellow. Its tongue hangs out, and its eyes are wild. Fox looks back at it with the identical expression for a minute, mesmerized -- then Fox closes his mouth and his eyes soften. Fox raises his paw in the air. The wolf blinks a few times. It raises its paw in the air. It turns away and trots off into the woods. Fox says wistfully:"
4916,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"What a beautiful creature. Wish him luck, boys. Fox guns the motor. Gravel spits from under the spinning tires, and they tear off down the road. The shot booms down into the ground, below the grass, through buried pebbles, layers of soil, and subterranean mineral deposits."
4917,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,My darlings? Everyone looks to Fox. He signals them to follow him.
4918,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Nobody knows.
4919,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Watch your step. Fox takes everyone through an opening and starts climbing a metal ladder. He says theatrically:
4920,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Let's see, now. Where does this lead?"
4921,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Keep a good grip, everyone."
4922,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,I think I see a little sliver of light. What's this? Is that a door?
4923,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Shh. I'm going to crack open this trap door and see if something's on the other side. I highly doubt it, though. There's probably just more sewer. Fox clears his throat. Pause."
4924,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"You know, wouldn't it be surprising if --"
4925,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Hey, look! There's a whole, enormous, glorious, gigantic supermarket up here! Ash and Kristofferson seem dumbstruck. Fox raises an eyebrow and smiles at Mrs. Fox. She puts her arm around his shoulder."
4926,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"Oh, really? Well, now's the time to buy. Kylie comes around the end of the aisle pushing a miniature shopping cart filled with jars of jelly, jam, olives, pickles, and honey, plus three loaves of bread, Band-Aids, toothpaste, and a carton of strawberry ice cream. He says"
4927,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,Because we were talking about other things.
4928,Fantastic-Mr-Fox,FOX,"The white cape rather suits him, doesn't it? Actually, I had to do quite a bit of searching myself before I found a look that really flattered me. Remember those horseshoe cuff-links? Fox and Mrs. Fox crack-up laughing. Fox notices something and stops. He stares at Mrs. Fox strangely. She is glowing. She hesitates. She shrugs."
4929,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Don't make a fuss. I'm fine. I'll get up.
4930,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I have a test today. I have to take it. I want to get into a good college so I can have a fruitful life...
4931,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"I'm okay, Mom. I feel perfectly...Oh, God!"
4932,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Is that Jeanie? I can't see that far. Jeanie?
4933,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Please don't be upset with me, Jeanie. Be thankful that you're fit and have your health. Cherish it."
4934,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I'll be okay. I'll just sleep. Maybe I'll have an aspirin around noon.
4935,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"It's nice to know I have such loving, caring parents. You're both very special people."
4936,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,They bought it.
4937,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Incredible! One of the worst performances of my career and they never doubted it for a second. What a beautiful day!
4938,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Parents always fall for the clammy hands. It's physical evidence of illness. It's a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are generally pretty hip to the fever scams. And to make them work you have to go a hundred and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous mother and you end up in a doctor's office and that's worse than school."
4939,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Fake a stomach cramp and when you're doubled over, moaning and wailing, just lick your palms. It's a little stupid and childish but then so if high school. Right?"
4940,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"This is my ninth sick day with semester. If I go for ten, I'm probably going to have to barf up a lung. So, I absolutely must make this one count."
4941,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"I don't care if you're fifty five or seven, everybody needs a day off now and then. It's a beautiful day. How can I be expected to handle high school?"
4942,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I do actually have a test. That wasn't bullshit.
4943,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,That I care about it was.
4944,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"It's on European socialism. I mean, really. What's the point? I'm not European. I don't plan to be European. So, who gives a shit if they're socialists? They could be fascist anarchists and it still wouldn't change the fact that I don't own a car."
4945,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"WELL SHAKE IT UP, BABY, TWIST AND SHOUT..."
4946,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Not that I condone fascism. Or and ""isms"". ""Isms"", in my opinion are not good. A person should not believe in an ""ism"". He should believe in himself. John Lennon said it on his first solo album. ""I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in me."" A good point there. Afterall, he was the Walrus."
4947,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I could be the Walrus and I'd still have to bum rides off people.
4948,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I'm not very political? Let me put that into perspective...
4949,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"My uncle went to Canada to protest the war, right? On the Fourth of July he was down with my aunt and he got drunk and told my Dad he felt guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam. So I said, ""What's the deal, Uncle Jeff? In wartime you want to be a pacifist and in peacetime you want to be a soldier. It took you twenty years to find out you don't believe in anything?"" Grounded. Just like that. Two weeks. Be careful when you deal with old hippies. They can be real touchy."
4950,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"My mother was a hippie. But she lost it. She got old. If she listens to the White Album now? She doesn't hear music, she hears memories. Nostalgia is her favorite drug. It'll probably be mine, too. I hope not."
4951,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,In eighth grade a friend of mine made a bong out of one of these. The smoke tasted like glue.
4952,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"His name is Garth Volbeck. He's a serious outsider. Not a bad guy, I like him. I'm probably his only friend. I do what I can for him. I mean, if I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others, right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station. His father's dead and his sister's rumored to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit. She only puts out so people will hang out with her. It's sad but I don't hold it against her. Better to hold it against the guys who use her and don't care about her. My parents never allowed Garth over here. It was because of his family. Mainly his older brother. He's in jail. I could see them not wanting his brother here because he is a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here. I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of artificial fruit just so he could see what it was like to have his stomach pumped. But Garth isn't his brother. It isn't his fault that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights with the parents on that point. I always felt for Garth. I was sleeping at his house once and I was laying on the dark worrying that his brother was going to come in and hack me to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying. I asked him what was wrong and he said, ""Nothing"". ... Nothing was wrong. There was no specific thing he was crying about. In fact, he wasn't really even aware that he was crying. He just cried himself to sleep every night. It was a habit. The guy's so conditioned to grief that if he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep. How could you possibly dump on guy who has to deal with that kinda shit? My parents acknowledge the trudge of the situation and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel for him but still the guy's banned from our house."
4953,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Unfortunately, now my parents have a legit argument. Garth doesn't need his brother to give him a rep anymore. He's getting one on his own. He's lost. It's over for him. He's eighteen. Gone from school. Gone from life. His legacy is a gas station."
4954,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,One very serious danger is playing sick is that it's possible to believe your own act.
4955,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,That and boredom. Alot of people ditch and feel great for about an hour. Then they realize there's nothing to do. TV and food. I myself have ditched and gotten so bored I did homework. Figure that shit out.
4956,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"You have to plan things out before you take the day off. Otherwise you get all nervous worrying about what to do and all you get is grief and the whole point is to take it easy, cut loose and enjoy."
4957,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"You blow your day and at about three o'clock, when everybody's out of school, you're going to wish you'd gone to school so you could be out having fun."
4958,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Avoid the misery. Plan your day. Do it right.
4959,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,There's alot of pressure at work in my age group. And it's not always recognized.
4960,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Some guy whose hair is falling out and his stomach's hanging over his belt and everything he eats makes him fart, he looks at someone like me and thinks, ""This kid's young and strong and has a full, rich future ahead of him, what's he got to bitch about?"""
4961,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,That's just one reason why I need a day off every now and then.
4962,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Food...shelter...no...yes...
4963,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Hello?
4964,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Very little.
4965,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Shredded.
4966,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,She's not home. Where are you?
4967,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I'm taking the day off. Get dressed and come over.
4968,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,It's all in your head. Come on over.
4969,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"I feel like complete shit, Ferris. I can't go anywhere."
4970,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I'm dying.
4971,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"If anybody needs a day off, it's Cameron. He has alot of things to sort out before he graduates. He can't be wound this tight and go to college. His roommate'll kill him. I've come close myself. But I like him. He's a little easier to take when you know why he's like he is. The boy cannot relax. Pardon by French but Cameron is so tight that if you stuck a lump of coal up his ass, in two weeks you'd have a diamond. And Cameron would worry that he'd owe taxes on it."
4972,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,This is really degrading.
4973,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Financing my activities this way. Very damaging to the self-image. But, hey, I'm broke. In times of crisis one must to what one must to. I'll pay it back. With interest."
4974,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Regardless of how much shit sisters make you eat, how often they rat on you, how gross they act or how wicked and insensitive they can be, you should not alientate them. Because most likely they have cash and it's usually very easy to get your hands on."
4975,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I wanted a car. I got a computer. How's that for being born under a bad sign?
4976,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"A sample of my blood was sent to Atlanta to the Center for Disease Control. I don't know, man, I'm bricking heavily. Freshman. Did you see Alien? When the guy had the creature in his stomach? It feels like that."
4977,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Cameron, if you're not over here in fifteen minutes, you can find a new best friend. I'm serious, man. This is bullshit, making me wait around the house for you."
4978,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I'm sick. I feel like shit. Why can't you leave me alone?
4979,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,You want to stay home and try to have the shits? Try to barf? Try to feel worse?
4980,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Be a man. Take some Pepto Bismol and get dressed. You're boring me with this stuff.
4981,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Squeeze you buns for a second. I got another call.
4982,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,H--hell-o?
4983,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I'm so worried about falling behind.
4984,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Dad? Can you hold on a second?
4985,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Just a little phlegm on the phone. Hold on.
4986,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Cameron? It's my Dad.
4987,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"It's completely cool. He's just checking up on me. Now, listen to me. I'm working on getting some heavy bucks out of him. So, the least you can do is hurry up and get over here. Bye."
4988,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Sorry, Dad. The moment before you called, I had a chest spasm and I blew lung fluid all over the place. It was making me ill looking at it. But gee, it's sure great of you to call. I'm sure there're alot of fathers who wouldn't take time out from their busy schedules to call a dumb, sick teenager."
4989,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Give yourself some credit, Dad. It was a mammoth gesture. It's like those savings bonds you used to give me every Christmas. It was that kind of concern."
4990,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"You had to work hard for the money to buy those things, right?"
4991,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"You work so hard I'll bet you don't even remember where those bonds are, right?"
4992,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Oh, yeah? You're pulling my leg. You're just trying to cheer me up."
4993,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Was that a class move or what? The guy gave it up faster than a drunk Catholic girl. I hope my kids don't pull this shit on me. Of course, if they didn't, they'd be dumb and abnormal and they'd probably never move out of my house and I'd have to support them until I die. I take it back. Dad? All this talking has made me kind of light-headed. I think I better lie down."
4994,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"You don't have to, Dad."
4995,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"You win some, you lose some."
4996,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I'm so disappointed in Cameron. Twenty bucks says he's sitting in his car debating about whether or not he should go out.
4997,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,We're gonna get caught. No doubt about it.
4998,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I'm not doing it.
4999,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,He'll keep calling until I come over.
5000,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"Actually, what'll happen is I'll get caught. Ferris'll escape."
5001,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Cameron'll go on like that for a good thirty minutes. The guy is a shellfish when it comes to making a decision. The reason he doesn't fell good is, he worries about everything. He's the only guy I know who's deeply concerned that when he grows up there'll be a critical shortage of strategic metals."
5002,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Cameron's also the only guy I know who knows what strategic metals are. Pardon moi.
5003,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"MAYBE I'M JUST LIKE MY MOTHER, SHE'S NEVER SATISFIED..."
5004,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Dead grandmother.
5005,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Mr. Rooney? I'm sorry to disturb you at work but I was wondering if it would be possible for my sister to bring home any assignments from my classes that I may need.
5006,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"You oughta be sorry for Christ's sake! A family member dies and you insult me. What's the matter with you, anyway?"
5007,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"This isn't over yet, buster. You just make sure my daughter's out in front of the school in ten minutes. Do you read me?"
5008,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"Call me sir, goddamn it!"
5009,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,That's better.
5010,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"I'm scared shitless, Ferris! What is Rooney guesses my voice!"
5011,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Impossible. You're doing great.
5012,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I don't have all day to bark at you so I'll make this short and sweet.
5013,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Great!
5014,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I want my daughter out in front of the school in ten minutes. By herself. I don's want anyone around...
5015,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,What'd I do?
5016,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Out in front my herself? It's too suspicious! He'll think something's up, moron. Cover it."
5017,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,You do it!
5018,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Talk!
5019,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"I changed my mind, fella. You be out in front with her! I wanna have a few words with you!"
5020,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Why'd you hit me?!
5021,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Where's your brain?!
5022,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Why'd you hit me?!
5023,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Where's your brain?!
5024,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Why'd you hit me?
5025,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Where's your brain?
5026,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I asked you first.
5027,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,How can we pick up Sloane if Rooney's going to be there with her?!
5028,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I said for her to be there alone and you freaked!
5029,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"My, God, you're so stupid! I didn't hit you, I lightly slapped you."
5030,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"You hit me. Look, don't ask me to participate in your crap if you don't like the way I do it!"
5031,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"I was home, sick. You get me out of bed, being me over here, make me jeopardize my future, make me do a phoney phone call on a dean of students, a man who could squeeze my nuts into oblivion and then you deliberately hurt my feelings."
5032,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I didn't deliberately hurt your feelings.
5033,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"Oh, really?"
5034,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Yeah, really."
5035,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"Hey, Ferris? Have a nice life."
5036,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Cameron?
5037,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"Stick it up your ass, Ferris."
5038,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Cameron, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to jam you. It was uncalled for."
5039,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,You're serious?
5040,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Dead serious.
5041,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Thanks.
5042,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"You did screw up through, right? Not that is was necessarily all you fault. Right?"
5043,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Why?
5044,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"To fix this situation, I'm going to have to ask you for a small favor."
5045,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"1958 Ferrari 250 GTS California. Less than a hundred were made. It has a market value of $265,000. My father spent three years restoring it. It is joy, it is his love, it is his passion."
5046,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,It is his fault he didn't lock the garage.
5047,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"Ferris, my father loves this car more than life itself. We can't take is out."
5048,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,A man with priorities so far out of whack doesn't deserve such a fine automobile.
5049,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"He never drives it, Ferris. He just rubs it with a diaper."
5050,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"We can't pick up Sloane in your car, Cameron. Rooney'd never believe Mr. Peterson drives that piece of shit."
5051,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,It's not a piece of shit.
5052,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"It's a piece of shit. Don't worry about it. I don't even have a piece of shit. I have to envy yours. Look, I'm sorry but there's nothing else we can do."
5053,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"He knows the mileage, Ferris. He has it tatooed on his wrist."
5054,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,He doesn't trust you?
5055,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,No.
5056,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Alright, look, this is real simple. He puts his arm around Cameron."
5057,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Whatever miles we put on it, we'll take off."
5058,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,How?
5059,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,We'll drive home backwards.
5060,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"Forget it. I'm putting my foot down, Ferris. You'll have to think of something else..."
5061,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Are you crazy?! Put the top back up!
5062,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,This is perfect top-down weather.
5063,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,What about Rooney?
5064,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Cameron, the more obvious we are, the less likely we are to get caught."
5065,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,That makes no sense whatsoever.
5066,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"The adult mind is a suspicious machine. Stay down, man."
5067,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Howcome it's my Dad's car and I'm taking all the risk and I have to ride back here?
5068,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I don't have an explanation.
5069,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Huh?
5070,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Oh. Um. Yeah. Very. She was a terrific lady. Very hip. Very old. Yeah.
5071,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Hurry along now!
5072,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,I guess that's my Dad. Thanks. See ya.
5073,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,This is so great! I can't believe it! Right in front of Rooney!
5074,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"Hi, Cameron. You comfortable?"
5075,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Hi. No.
5076,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,What a fabulous car!
5077,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Enjoy it quick. It' s going home.
5078,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"It was risky, it was bold but it was totally necessary."
5079,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,What're we gonna do?
5080,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"The question isn't ""what are we gonna do"", the question is ""what aren't we going to do."""
5081,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Don't tell me we're not going to take the car home. Please.
5082,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,If you had access to a car like this would you take it back right away? Would you give up feeling like a ton just to ease your best friend's tension?
5083,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Either would I.
5084,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Hello, Mrs. Froeling. How are you?"
5085,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Me? I'm out of school, Mrs. Froeling. In fact. I'm married. This is my wife...Madonna."
5086,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"And this is my brother-in-law, ZZ Top. ZZ, this is Mrs. Froeling."
5087,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Yeah.
5088,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"I'd like to cash these in, please. We're having a baby and we need the cash for a crib, clothes, diapers, food pellets, leash, water dish..."
5089,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"I'm thrilled, ma'am. I'm especially looking forward to wearing those jeans with the stretch panel in front."
5090,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"Actually, we're hoping for a car."
5091,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Shit...
5092,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I'm aware of that.
5093,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"No, ma'am, I'm giving it to the government. They need it. Do you know what an aircraft carrier's going for these days?"
5094,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,We can't come to the phone right now. We've had a death in the family. If you need to reach us we'll be at the following number...
5095,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,We can't leave the car here!
5096,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Why not?
5097,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Because we can't! I want it back home where it belongs!
5098,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,What could happen to it?
5099,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"It could get stolen, wrecked, scratched, you name it."
5100,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I'll give the guy a five to watch it.
5101,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,What guy?
5102,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,You speak English?
5103,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Great. I want to you take extra special care of this vehicle, okay?"
5104,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I appreciate it.
5105,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,See what a finski can do to a person's attitude? He's going to treat it like a beautiful woman.
5106,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"Yeah, sure. Whip it with a stick and piss on the hood."
5107,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"Oh, please, Cameron. Do you have to be so graphic?"
5108,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,This is so right!
5109,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"This is the world's tallest building. From our vantage point here on the 103 floor, we are provided with a view of four states."
5110,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Do you think the car's alright?
5111,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and my personal favorite, Indiana."
5112,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"I don't feel good, Ferris. Are we gonna stay long?"
5113,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Take a step back...
5114,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Now, lean against the glass. Like this..."
5115,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,And look down.
5116,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"Oh, shit!"
5117,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,What if the glass gives?
5118,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Death.
5119,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Cool.
5120,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I think I see my Dad.
5121,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Do you love me?
5122,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Do you love me?
5123,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,I asked you first.
5124,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Yes. You?
5125,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Yes.
5126,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Would I trash a day of education to be with you if I didn't love you?
5127,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Yes.
5128,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Would I risk damaging a deep and wonderfully enriching relationship with my parents if I didn't love you?
5129,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Yes.
5130,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Would I have introduced you as my wife if I didn't love you?
5131,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Wait a minute. That was a lie.
5132,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,True.
5133,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Would you want to get married? I mean if I wasn't an asshole.
5134,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Sure.
5135,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Today?
5136,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I'm game.
5137,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,No way!
5138,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"I'll do it, if you will."
5139,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,You need a blood test.
5140,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Huh?
5141,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"If your blood's not compatible, you could produce a pinhead. The state requires a blood test."
5142,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,So?
5143,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"So, you can't get married today."
5144,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Tomorrow?
5145,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,If you get a blood test today.
5146,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,I'm not getting married.
5147,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"I'm with you, babe."
5148,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Why not?
5149,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"What do you mean, why not? Think about it."
5150,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Besides being too young and your father hating my guts and not having any place to live and feeling awkward about being the only cheer- leader with a husband, give me a good reason why not."
5151,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I'll give you two. My mother and father.
5152,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,They're married and they hate each other. You've seen them. Am I right?
5153,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"You're father's a toad and your Mom's always wired out, but so what? They're old. That's natural."
5154,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,It makes me puke. Seeing people treat each other like that. It's like the car. He loves the car. He hates his wife.
5155,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,My parents are divorced. So what? It's not like it doesn't happen ten thousand times a day.
5156,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Just because it happens doesn't make it right. Are you comfortable with it?
5157,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,No. It's not something I can get comfortable with. I've tried. Are yours divorced?
5158,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,They may as well be.
5159,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Do you think they're staying together because of you?
5160,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Do they like you?
5161,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Yeah. Sure.
5162,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Consider this...my father canned me and my brother and my Mom for a twenty five year old dipso with fake tits. He dropped us like a rock. Everything was cool at our house. I thought so. We all thought so. Then BLAM! It's over.
5163,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,This is all news to me. She keeps a pretty good secret.
5164,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"It was pure selfishness. When I have a kid, I don't care how much I want something, if it's gonna screw-up the kid, forget it."
5165,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,She's not lying.
5166,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,You could change.
5167,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Yeah. But I'm gonna try not to. I'm gonna think about it. I'm gonna try to prevent it.
5168,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"This is optomism. It's a common trait with my age group. Adults think it's cute, it's like a charming quick that infests youth. But it's a cool thing and I think, deep down, crusty old shits wish they had some. They wish they had her, too. Sorry. She's taken."
5169,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"I'd rather not have my family break apart, thank you."
5170,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"Well, you know what? It ain't up to you. It's out of your hands."
5171,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"So, I in other words, I should just sit back and watch it crumble?"
5172,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,You're merely an inhabitant in their universe.
5173,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Frightening choice of words.
5174,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"They call the shots. When you split from them, you call the shots."
5175,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"So, you're saying I should run away?"
5176,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,No. She's saying it's time for lunch.
5177,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,What?
5178,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Let's go feed Cameron.
5179,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,BUY!
5180,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Yes. I'm Abe Frohman. Party of three for 12:00.
5181,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Is there a problem?
5182,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I'm Abe Frohman.
5183,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Are you suggesting that I'm not who I say I am?
5184,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Let's go...Abe.
5185,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I'm not going anywhere. Call the police. Go ahead. Better yet... ...I'll call myself.
5186,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"You touch me and I yell ""rat!"" There's another phone around here. Find it."
5187,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"Ferris, let's split, please?"
5188,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Cameron's right. We're gonna get busted.
5189,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Not a chance in the world.
5190,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Ask for Abe Frohman.
5191,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Don't grovel, Charles. Just leave us to our repast and all will be forgotten."
5192,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Thank you.
5193,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Darling, you were wonderful."
5194,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"Oh, but I had a wonderful teacher."
5195,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Cameron, dear friend?"
5196,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,And you thought we wouldn't have any fun. Shame on you.
5197,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"She's a person who views life as an ordeal that must be endured. Her body is a transport vehicle for her anger. I don't know where she gets this shit. Basically, the family's pretty cool."
5198,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I wonder if everybody shoots at cigarette butts in urinals? Probably not many women. I used to think that my family was the only one that had weirdness in it. It used to worry me. Then I met Cameron and I saw how his family functioned.
5199,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Cameron's home life is really shit. He wasn't lying. That's why he's sick all the time. It really upsets him. What he said about his parents hating each other? I refuse to sleep over at his house. His parents fight all the time. Even when I'm there. Is there anything worse than being at somebody's house when their parents are fighting? It's the absolute height of social discomfort.
5200,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"When they go after each other, Cameron tightens up. It's scary. He gets so wadded-up, you couldn't pry his buns apart with a crowbar. The thing with taking his old man's car? It's good for him. It teaches him to deal with his fear. Plus, and I must be honest here, I love driving it. I highly recommend picking one up."
5201,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,What is it?
5202,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,I don't know. But it looks like it's already been eaten and digested.
5203,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I knew it was a mistake letting Ferris order for us.
5204,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,What are you doing?
5205,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,What is this shit?
5206,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,You got me. I don't speak French.
5207,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I think it's a land-based beefoid creature.
5208,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Splendid.
5209,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Really?
5210,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Superb.
5211,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Good?
5212,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Yo, Clouseau!"
5213,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I have a growth on my brain that causes memory lapses. Could you tell me what we ordered here?
5214,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Uh, huh. And what might that be?"
5215,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,As in the gland that has important functions in digestion and metabolism?
5216,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"...That secretes a thick, colorless fluid containing digestive enzymes? The home of the world famous isles of Langerhans?"
5217,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Check, please!"
5218,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"40,000 restaurants in the downtown area and I pick the one my father goes to."
5219,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"We're gonna get nabbed, for sure."
5220,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"No way, Cameron. Only the meek get nabbed. The bold survive. Let's go."
5221,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,I wonder if he has a name?
5222,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Ninth Month.
5223,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Are you guys worried about nuclear war?
5224,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Cameron, it's a beautiful day, we've won our freedom, we're traveling down one of American's most scenic polluted waterways and you have to bring up nuclear war?"
5225,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"It is kind of raggy subject, Cam."
5226,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Regardless. It's with us every day. The possiblity of global destruction.
5227,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"Don't you think it's an issue because people need something to worry about? They have to like, have some major problem that puts all their little bullshit into some kind of persepective?"
5228,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Maybe.
5229,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"They used to have Viet Nam. They used to have the oil crisis stuff and Iran. That's over and people have to have their big issue. It's not like somebody came up with the nuclear holocaust yesterday at noon, you know."
5230,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"To answer your question...No, I'm not worried about it at all."
5231,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"We don't know when the bombs going off. We do know, however, that college starts in the fall."
5232,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Do you know what a nuclear winter is?
5233,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"Yeah. Everybody's dead, it's real cold and the skiing's for shit."
5234,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,My step-father's always going off about how when he was young he was committed to all these causes.
5235,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,He's full of shit. All the old hippies are full of shit.
5236,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,He says I don't care about things like he did.
5237,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,What's he care about now?
5238,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"Baldness, fatty meats and money."
5239,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I rest my case.
5240,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,What's spooky is they still control everything. They took over when they were young and they never gave it up.
5241,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,One of the most frightening experiences of my young life has been observing my parents and our neighbors playing the Baby Boom Edition of Trivial Pursuits. It's chilling to see people crazed with the minutia of their past.
5242,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,It's human nature to like what you had better than what you have.
5243,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Agreed.
5244,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"You know, this is all very interesting but I'm starving."
5245,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,An hour ago you wanted to yack.
5246,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I feel better now.
5247,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Lean over and grab a fish.
5248,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,What comes after a nuclear winter?
5249,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Nuclear spring.
5250,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I think I broke my thumb.
5251,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Can we leave now?
5252,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,You want to leave? We just got here.
5253,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"You got a call, you broke your thumb, what's left to do?"
5254,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,No wonder you're always sick.
5255,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Do you realize that if I played by the rules, right now I'd be in gym?"
5256,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,I love him.
5257,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,It's hard not to.
5258,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Stop...water...want...
5259,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Do you believe in reincarnation?
5260,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Huh?
5261,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Do you believe that you lived before?
5262,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Yeah. Sort of.
5263,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,DO you ever wonder what you were?
5264,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I don't have to wonder. I know.
5265,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I was a tractor tire.
5266,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Guten tag, dude!"
5267,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,What were you in a previous life?
5268,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,I'm not sure but I think I know who Ferris was.
5269,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Hannibal.
5270,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,From the A-Team?
5271,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,No. The guy who rode the elephants into Switzerland.
5272,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"I think if he was anybody, he was Magellan. You know, the guy who went around the world."
5273,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,I could see him ignoring popular belief and taking off on some impossible mission.
5274,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"Yeah. As long as I've known him, everything works for him. There's nothing he can't handle. I can't handle anything. School, parents, the future. Ferris can do anything."
5275,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"WELL, SHAKE IT UP, BABY, NOW!"
5276,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,TWIST AND SHOUT!
5277,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, BABY ON! COME ON AND WORK IT ON OUT!"
5278,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"The future's worse for a boy, isn't it?"
5279,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,A girl can always bail out and have a baby and get some guy to support her.
5280,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,That's a pretty grim thought.
5281,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"True, but it's an option. No options is worse."
5282,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I don't know what I'm gonna do.
5283,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,College.
5284,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"Yeah, but to do what?"
5285,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,What are you interested in?
5286,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Nothing.
5287,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Me either.
5288,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,What do you think Ferris is gonna do?
5289,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,AH!
5290,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Who is it?
5291,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Have a nice day.
5292,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"How does she do that? One goes one way, one goes the other."
5293,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,She's probably schizophrenic.
5294,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"Ferris, this is nauseating me. Really. I'm losing respect for you by the bucket."
5295,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,You don't think it's amazing that we got in?
5296,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Who wants to get in?
5297,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Cameron looks like a toddler, for Christ's sake. I'm talking about a major achievement in false identification."
5298,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,I'm not interested in watching someone jiggle their mammary glands.
5299,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Point well taken. But consider why she does it. Why she does it and you don't.
5300,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,I'm not a tramp.
5301,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Maybe her life fell apart. Maybe she lost somebody. A lover. A boyfriend. A parent. A child... This kind of thing makes me a little depressed. You may think because I'm the age I am that I'm a sex maniac. That sex is all I think about. But that's not true. I'm a romantic. I think alot of people my age are. We think about love and matters of the heart. And SAT scores and acne aside, we worry about lonliness. It's a terrible thing. And we feel it. I feel it."
5302,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"You know, someone said the world's a stage and each must play a part. Fate had me playing in love, with you as my sweetheart. Act one was when we met. I loved you at first glance. You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue. Then came act two. You seemed to change. You acted strange. And why, I've never known."
5303,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Honey, you lies when you said you loved me and I had no cause to doubt you. But I'd rather go on hearing your lies than to go on living without you. Now, the stage is bare and I'm standing there with emptiness all around and if you won't come back to me, then they can bring the curtain down..."
5304,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,So...
5305,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"So, Yuri, how long have you been in America?"
5306,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,What's your overall impression?
5307,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Better than Russia?
5308,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Clearly you've never been to an American high school.
5309,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"It's getting late, Ferris. I have to get the car home. I know you don't care, but it means my ass."
5310,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,You think I don't care?
5311,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I know you don't care.
5312,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"That hurts, Cameron."
5313,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"Jump back, Ferris, Cameron's been a good sport."
5314,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Cameron, what'd you see today?"
5315,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"You saw four states, a submarine, a giant heart, seventy five dollars worth of cooked pancreas, two of the most incredible breasts ever to come out of modern plastics, major league baseball and... Are you gonna chuck your nachos?"
5316,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,What's he doing?
5317,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,He's looking at me and he's licking the glass and making obscene gestures with his hands.
5318,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,What?!
5319,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Roast!
5320,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Money...tits...please...
5321,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Bueller. Ferris Bueller.
5322,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,It's cool.
5323,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"I'm going to tell a massive lie here. It's going to by very thick and very steamy. I think radio's a facinating medium, it challenges the imagination. Unlike television which provides the images, radio... You know this. Anyway, it's always been a dream of mine to be on the radio. I have what I consider to be an excellent broadcast voice. I practise it in the bathroom all the time. I used to play records and do introductions to them. But I've never had the chance to sit behind a microphone and try it out for real. This is a 50,000 watt outlet. I'm going out to several million people so let me just say, I'm in a very pleasant groove right now. Well, Steve, you and your listeners are probably not going to believe this but..."
5324,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"I was going to say I knew Springsteen's home phone number and I was going to give out the number of the New Jersey State Police but I thought I might get busted. After I got flunked in driver's ed for sideswiping a mail box, which was not in any way, shape or from my fault. I was putting out a cigarette, like I was told. It was weird. I'm so used to getting in a car and lighting up, because I'm not allowed to smoke at home, that I got in the driver's ed. car and spaced completely, pulled out of the lot, lit up a 'boro and Mrs. Heller looked at me like I'd just pulled a bunny out of my nose or something and I realized what the hell I was doing and I went to put it out and hit the mail box. Anyway, I was so pissed off at her reaction to the whole thing that I considered running an ad in a sleaze magazine for a school teacher that does phone sex and I was gonna use Mrs. Heller's home number but is cost too much. I took it again and passed. But I had to work at Burger King to get the cash to pay for the driver's ed. car. The car got fixed in auto shop for nothing and I think Rooney pocketed the cash. But I can't prove it? I'm in high school, remember?"
5325,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,It's kind of a long story but I've been doing alot of programming for NASA.
5326,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Just out of curiosity, what was your top speed coming down the ramp?"
5327,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Stunning!
5328,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,This is probably the last time you'll have to ride back here. Keep that in mind.
5329,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,What's next.
5330,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Nothing. We return the car.
5331,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,We could go to my house. My parents aren't coming home until late.
5332,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,We have enough cash left for a quick flight to Peoria and back.
5333,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Very funny.
5334,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Cameron? How many miles did you say this thing had when we left?
5335,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,One hundred and twenty six and halfway between three and four tenths. Why? How many miles are on it now?
5336,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Here's where Cameron goes berserk.
5337,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,You okay?
5338,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Hey, Cameron. It's okay. We'll fix it."
5339,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Cameron! Cut it out! What's wrong?! Ferris!
5340,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Cameron, are you okay? It's no problem, really. Your old man won't know a thing. It's completely fixable."
5341,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"Shut-up! It is a problem! For him it's a problem. Nothing's a problem for you. But it's a problem for him! So, just shut-up."
5342,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"What can I do, Cameron?"
5343,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"This may very well be for real. I think Cameron might have blown a micro-chip or two. He's always been a little keyed-up. All I wanted to do was give him a good day. We're gonna graduate in a couple of months. Then we have the summer. He'll work and I'll work. And we'll see each other at night and on the weekends but then he'll go to one school and I'll go to another. And basically that'll be it. As much as we like each other, the process of growing up will separate us."
5344,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Sloane's a bigger problem. She still has another year of high school. How do I deal with that? I was serious when I said I'd marry her. I would. This isn't just teenage infatuation. That's what my parents call it. What do they call what they have? If that's love, I'll take infatuation."
5345,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Cameron's never been in love. At least no one's ever been in love with him. He's gonna marry the first girl he lays. And she's gonna treat him like shit because he's gonna kiss her ass for giving him what he's built-up in his mind as the end-all, be-all of human existance. She won't respect him because you can't respect someone who kisses your ass. It just doesn't work."
5346,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Ferris?
5347,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I'm being tested here.
5348,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"My best friend has flipped-out. Conventional wisdom would suggest a visit to the nearest trauma center. I wouldn't fault anybody for doing that. My, personally, I think this calls for something new, something bold, something wet and wild."
5349,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"You feeling any better, Cameron?"
5350,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,The water's really nice. I wish you'd come in.
5351,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Surgery...fire...move...
5352,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Cameron? Do you think this because of the car or is it a combination of everything shitty in your life?
5353,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Music...kiss...attack...
5354,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,You just can't deal with anymore shit? The car took you into the red zone? Time for a reality check?
5355,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"Cameron? I could flip real easy, too. There's nothing wrong with it. At one time or another, everybody goes to the zoo."
5356,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Maybe he was actually sick. Maybe he wasn't bullshitting himself.
5357,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Gesundheit...God...mercy...
5358,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,CAMERON!
5359,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,What?
5360,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,You asshole!
5361,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,What?
5362,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,What's so funny?
5363,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"The whole time I was just thinking things over. I was like, meditating. I was thinking about the future. And I realized it doesn't make and difference if the present goes to shit."
5364,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I have a agree with you there.
5365,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Really.
5366,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"I've been thinking all day that if you could only have the use of one word, what would it be?"
5367,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Sloane is naked before your eyes and you're thinking about words?
5368,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"God bless you, Cameron."
5369,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"Thank you, Sloane."
5370,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"If you guys only had one word, what would it be?"
5371,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I can't believe you'd think up something like with a naked girl in a jacuzzi right in front of you.
5372,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"Come on, Ferris, answer his question."
5373,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Bathroom.
5374,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,I'd say...
5375,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Cash.
5376,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,It's the only word you could ever use.
5377,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Hello.
5378,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Love.
5379,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"And what is you loathe somebody? Are you going to say ""love"" every time you see them?"
5380,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"It's better than ""hello""."
5381,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Hellos' generic.
5382,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,You wanna be generic?
5383,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,It's help.
5384,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,The word is help.
5385,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,Ferris? It's not working.
5386,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"The miles aren't coming off, running it in reverse."
5387,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I thought that might be a problem. Let's crack open the odometer and roll it back by hand.
5388,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I got a better idea. It's cool.
5389,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"Seventeen years and I've never taken a stand. Now, I'm gonna do it. I'm taking a stand against my father, against my family, against myself, against my past, my present and my future. I will not sit idly by as events that affect me unfold to change the course of my life. I will take a stand and I will defend it. When my father comes home tonight, he's finally going to have to deal with me. Good or bad, I'm taking a stand."
5390,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,This is a big U-2 fan.
5391,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,What was that about?
5392,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,This has to be a dream.
5393,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Cameron? One quick question. Why'd you do that?
5394,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,You trashed the car.
5395,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,Why?
5396,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I took a stand.
5397,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"No, Cameron. You wrecked a car."
5398,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,It's okay.
5399,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I have an idea. If you're interested.
5400,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,I'm gonna handle it.
5401,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I think this could work.
5402,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"No, thanks. I want to deal with it by myself."
5403,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,What about your one word?
5404,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,"You already did it. If I need it again, I'll use it."
5405,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,CAMERON,It's cool. I'm loose.
5406,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,I had a great time today.
5407,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Yeah. It was pretty cool.
5408,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,You think Cameron's gonna be alright?
5409,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Sure. He had to so it, I guess. His old man had it coming. He'll be okay. I'd be worried if he'd taken my idea."
5410,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,"You didn't have an idea, did you?"
5411,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Not a glimmer.
5412,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,You're so smart.
5413,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,No. I'm just real loose.
5414,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I'll call you tonight.
5415,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,I LOVE YOU!
5416,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,SLOANE,He's gonna marry me. I know it.
5417,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Yes.
5418,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"No, but Kimberly's is."
5419,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Thanks, Jeanie."
5420,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"By the way, I borrowed some cash from you. I'll pay you back."
5421,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,I want to.
5422,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,It's completely cool.
5423,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Upstairs, Mom!"
5424,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Vaguely.
5425,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,He's cool. But stay away from his brother.
5426,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"150% better, thank you."
5427,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"I'm much better, really. Please, don't make me stay home again. I want to go to school. I'm graduating in June and I..."
5428,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Maybe you're right, Dad."
5429,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,Years of practice.
5430,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,"Yeah, life is a carousel. A great big crazy ball of pure living, breathing joy and delight."
5431,Ferris-Buellers-Day-Off,FERRIS,You gotta get one.
5432,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Wow.
5433,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Wow.
5434,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Wow.
5435,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think that we we're gonna get the whole ocean, did you? Huh? [sighs] Oh yeah. A fish can breath out here. Did your man deliver or did he deliver?"
5436,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,And it wasn't so easy.
5437,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,You better believe they did--every single one of them.
5438,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"So, you do like it, don't you?"
5439,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look, look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and they'll see a whale! See, right by their bedroom window."
5440,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Oh, right. Right."
5441,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"You wanna name all of 'em, right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr. and then this half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done."
5442,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Nemo? Well, we'll name one Nemo but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr."
5443,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Yeah. What if they don't like me?
5444,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, really."
5445,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,You remember how we met?
5446,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Well, I remember. 'Excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip?'"
5447,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Here he is. Cutie's here! Where did everybody go?
5448,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"[gasps] Coral, get inside the house, Coral. No, Coral, don't. They'll be fine. Just get inside, you, right now."
5449,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,No!
5450,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Coral! Coral?
5451,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Coral? Oh!
5452,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Ohh. There, there, there. It's okay, daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise, I will never let anything happen to you...Nemo."
5453,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"First day of school! First day of school! Wake up, wake up! C'mon, first day of school!"
5454,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,I don't wanna go to school. Five more minutes.
5455,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Not you, dad. Me!"
5456,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Okay...huh?
5457,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Get up, get up! It's time for school! It's time for school! It's time for school! It's time for school! Oh boy! Oh boy!"
5458,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"All right, I'm up."
5459,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Oh boy--whoa!
5460,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Nemo!
5461,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,First day of school!
5462,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"[gasps] Nemo, don't move! Don't move! You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it. All right, where's the break? You feel a break?"
5463,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,No.
5464,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid is rushing to the area. Now, any rushing fluids?"
5465,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,No.
5466,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Are you woozy?
5467,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,No.
5468,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,How many stripes do I have?
5469,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,I'm fine.
5470,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Answer the stripe question!
5471,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Three.
5472,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No! See, something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three--that's all I have? Oh, you're okay. How's the lucky fin?"
5473,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Lucky.
5474,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Let's see.
5475,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Are you sure you wanna go to school this year? 'Cause there's no problem if you don't. You can wait 5 or 6 years.
5476,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Come on, dad. It's time for school."
5477,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Ah-ah-ah! Forgot to brush.
5478,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Ohh...
5479,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Do you want this anemone to sting you?
5480,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Yes.
5481,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Brush.
5482,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Okay, I'm done."
5483,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,You missed a spot.
5484,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Where?
5485,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here and here!
5486,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"All right, we're excited. First day of school, here we go. We're ready to learn to get some knowledge. Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?"
5487,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,It's not safe.
5488,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"That's my boy. So, first we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in. And then we go out, and back in. And then one more time--out and back in. And sometimes, if you wanna do it four times--"
5489,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Dad..
5490,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"All right. Come on, boy."
5491,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Dad, maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark!"
5492,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Have you ever met a shark?
5493,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, and I don't plan to."
5494,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,How old are sea turtles?
5495,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Sea turtles? I don't know.
5496,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Sandy Plankton from next door, he said that sea turtles, said that they live to be about a hundred years old!"
5497,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Well, you know what, if I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking to the shark, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on, wait to cross. Hold my fin, hold my fin."
5498,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Dad, you're not gonna freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you?"
5499,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Hey, that snail was about to charge. Hmm, I wonder where we're supposed to go."
5500,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Come on, we'll try over there."
5501,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?"
5502,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Yes. Shocking, I know."
5503,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Marlin.
5504,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Well, actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish."
5505,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"All right, I know one joke. Um, there's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea, well he doesn't walk up, he swims up. Well, actually the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place and then the sea cucumber, well they--I mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber. None of them were walking, so forget that I--"
5506,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Dad, dad...can I go play too? Can I?"
5507,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,I would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds.
5508,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,That's where I would play
5509,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"He was born with it, kids. We call it his lucky fin."
5510,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Dad.
5511,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Whoa, you better stay with me."
5512,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Dad, you can go now."
5513,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,I'm Nemo.
5514,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Okay.
5515,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,An anemo-none. A nemenem-menome-nememen-nenemone--
5516,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Just so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming, let him take a break. Ten, fifteen minutes."
5517,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Dad, it's time for you to go now."
5518,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Bye, Nemo!"
5519,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Bye, dad!"
5520,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Bye, son! Be safe."
5521,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you?"
5522,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"They just gotta grow up--the drop off?! They're going to the drop off?! Wh-what are you, insane?! Why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips!?"
5523,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy!"
5524,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Whoa.
5525,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Hey guys, wait up! Whoa."
5526,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,What's that?
5527,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Whoa.
5528,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Uh, my dad says it's not safe."
5529,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Nemo, no!"
5530,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Dad?
5531,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,You were about to swim into open water!
5532,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"No, I wasn't go out--but dad!"
5533,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"It was a good thing I was here. If I hadn't showed up, I don't know--"
5534,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"No, I wasn't."
5535,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"This does not concern you, kids. And you're lucky I don't tell your parents you were out there. You know you can't swim well."
5536,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"I can swim fine, dad, okay?"
5537,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, it's not okay. You shouldn't be anywhere near here. Okay, I was right. You'll start school in a year or two."
5538,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"No, dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean--"
5539,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Clearly, you're not ready. And you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do these things but you just can't, Nemo!"
5540,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,I hate you.
5541,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer and it's a little too soon for him to be out here unsupervised.
5542,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You're gonna get stuck out there and I'll have to get you before another fish does! Get back here! I said get back here, now! Stop! You take one move, mister. Don't youdare! If you put one fin on that boat..are you listening to me? Don't touch the bo--Nemo!"
5543,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"You paddle your little tail back here, Nemo. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man. Do you hear me? Big...big--"
5544,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Aaaah! Daddy! Help me!
5545,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"I'm coming, Nemo!"
5546,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Ah! Oh no! Dad! Daddy!
5547,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Oh! Nemo! Unh! Nemo! Nemo, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! No! Aah! Nemo! Nemo!"
5548,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Oh no. No, no. It's gone, it's gone. No, no, it can't be gone. No, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! Nemo! Nemo! No! No, please, no! No, no!"
5549,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Has anybody seen a boat!? Please! A white boat! They took my son! My son! Help me, please!"
5550,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Look out!
5551,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Waaaah!
5552,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Ooh, ooh..."
5553,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry! I didn't see you. Sir, are you okay?"
5554,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"He's gone, he's gone.."
5555,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"There, there. It's all right."
5556,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,He's gone.
5557,Finding-Nemo,DORY,It'll be okay.
5558,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat."
5559,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Hey, I've seen a boat."
5560,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,You have?
5561,Finding-Nemo,DORY,It passed by not too long ago.
5562,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,A white one?
5563,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Hi. I'm Dory.
5564,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Where!? Which way!?
5565,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Oh, oh, oh! It-it went, um, this way! And it went this way! Follow me!"
5566,Finding-Nemo,DORY,No problem.
5567,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Hey! Wait!
5568,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Will you quit it?
5569,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,What?
5570,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"I'm trying to swim here. What, ocean ain't big enough for you?"
5571,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Huh?
5572,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? You want a piece of me? Yeah, oooh, I'm scared now. Whaat!?"
5573,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Wait a minute..
5574,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Stop following me, okay!?"
5575,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,What? You're showing me which way the boat went!
5576,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way, it went this way. Follow me!"
5577,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going!"
5578,Finding-Nemo,DORY,I did? Oh dear...
5579,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny! And I know funny..I'm a clownfish!"
5580,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss."
5581,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Short-term memory loss..I don't believe this!
5582,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family..or at least I think it does. Hmmm..where are they? Can I help you?"
5583,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Something's wrong with you, really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. [gasps]"
5584,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Well, hi!"
5585,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Nothing. We're not doing anything. We're not even out.
5586,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Ooh, I love parties! Parties are fun!"
5587,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Parties are fun, and it's tempting but--"
5588,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,O-okay..that's all that matters.
5589,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Hey, look--balloons! It is a party!"
5590,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Hey there!
5591,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Ooh! Pick me! Pick me!
5592,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Woo-hoo!
5593,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Hi. I'm Dory.
5594,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"And, uh, well, I don't think I've ever eaten a fish."
5595,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Whew! I'm glad I got that off my chest.
5596,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Me? I don't have a problem.
5597,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Okay. Uh, hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish--"
5598,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Actually I do know one that's pretty good. There was this mollusk and he walks up to a sea cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers, but in a joke, everyone talks. So the sea mollusk says to the cucumber..."
5599,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Daddy!
5600,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Nemo!
5601,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, no, no, no. He's my son. He was taken by these divers."
5602,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Oh my, you poor fish."
5603,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Ugh! What do these markings mean?
5604,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,I can't read human.
5605,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Well then we gotta find a fish who can read this. Hey, look. Sharks!"
5606,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, no, no, Dory!"
5607,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Guys, guys!"
5608,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, Dory!"
5609,Finding-Nemo,DORY,That's mine! Give it to me! Gimme! Oww!
5610,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?"
5611,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Ow, ow, ow."
5612,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,I'm so sorry.
5613,Finding-Nemo,DORY,You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding?
5614,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Ohh...
5615,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Ow, ow, ow."
5616,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Dory, look out!"
5617,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,There's no way out! There's got to be a way to escape!
5618,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Who is it?
5619,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Dory, help me find a way out!"
5620,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Sorry, you'll have to come back later. We're trying to escape."
5621,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,There's gotta be a way out!
5622,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Look, here's something! 'ESSS-CA-PE'! I wonder what that means. It's funny, it's spelled just like the word 'escape'."
5623,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Let's go!
5624,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"I can read? That's right, I can read!"
5625,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Well, then here. Read this now!"
5626,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Oh no, it's blocked!"
5627,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,I need to get that mask!
5628,Finding-Nemo,DORY,You want that mask? Okay.
5629,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, no, no, no, no, no!"
5630,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Quick grab the mask!
5631,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Aw, is the party over?"
5632,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Dad? Daddy?
5633,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Aah!
5634,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh!
5635,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Aah!
5636,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,I wanna go home. Do you know where my dad is?
5637,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Pet store?
5638,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,I'm from the ocean.
5639,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Big...and blue?
5640,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,[gasps]
5641,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,What? What's wrong with her?
5642,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,I can't go with that girl! I have to get back to my dad! Aaah! Daddy! Help me!
5643,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Can you help me?
5644,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,I can't. I have a bad fin.
5645,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Nemo. I'm Nemo.
5646,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Nemo. Nemo. [mutters]
5647,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Are you gonna eat that? Careful with that hammer...
5648,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Huh? No, no! What does it say? Dory!"
5649,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Sea monkey has my money...
5650,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Wake up! Get up! Come on! Come on!
5651,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Yes, I'm a natural blue..."
5652,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Look out! Sharks eat fish! Aaaaaah!
5653,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Wow. Dusty.
5654,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"[gasps] The mask! Where's the mask? No! No, not the mask! Get it! Get the mask! Get the mask! Get it!"
5655,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"[singing] Hoo doot doo doot doot doo doot. Whoo-hoo! La la la la la la. Just keeps going on, doesn't it? Echo! Echo! Hey, what are you doing?"
5656,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,It's gone. I've lost the mask.
5657,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Did you drop it?
5658,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my son, now it's gone."
5659,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills. When life gets you down, you know what you gotta do?"
5660,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,I don't wanna know what you gotta do when life gets you down.
5661,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"[singing] Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What do we do? We swim, swim."
5662,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Dory, no singing."
5663,Finding-Nemo,DORY,[singing] Ho ho ho ho ho ho! I love to swim! When you want to swim..
5664,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song now it's in my head!"
5665,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Sorry.
5666,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Dory, do you see anything?"
5667,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Aaah! Something's got me!
5668,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,That was me. I'm sorry.
5669,Finding-Nemo,DORY,[gasps] Who was that?
5670,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Who could it be? It's me!
5671,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Are..are you my conscience?
5672,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Yeah, yeah. I'm your conscience. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you?"
5673,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Hmm, can't complain."
5674,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Yeah? Good. Now, Dory. I want you to tell me..do you see anything?"
5675,Finding-Nemo,DORY,I see..I see a light.
5676,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,A light.
5677,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Yeah. Over there. Hey, conscience. Am I dead?"
5678,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, I see it too. What is it?"
5679,Finding-Nemo,DORY,It's so pretty.
5680,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,I'm feeling...happy. Which is a big deal for me.
5681,Finding-Nemo,DORY,I want to touch it. Oh!
5682,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Hey, come back. Come on back here."
5683,Finding-Nemo,DORY,[singing] I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna swim with you.
5684,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna be your best friend...good feeling's gone.
5685,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,I can't see! I don't know where I'm going!
5686,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Haah!
5687,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,The mask!
5688,Finding-Nemo,DORY,What mask?
5689,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Okay, I can't see a thing."
5690,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Oh, gee!"
5691,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Hey, look! A mask!"
5692,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Read it!
5693,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"I'm sorry, but if you could just bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light. That's great, keep it right there."
5694,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Just read it!
5695,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Okay, okay. Mr. Bossy. Uh, 'P'. Okay, 'P'. 'Shh-eer...Sher--P. Sher--P. Shirley? P.--'. Oh! The first line's 'P. Sherman'!"
5696,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,P. Sherman doesn't make any sense!
5697,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Okay, second line. '42'."
5698,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Don't eat me! Don't eat me! Aaaah!
5699,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Light, please. 'Walla--Walla--Walla-beee'..."
5700,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Waah! Waaah! Waaaah!
5701,Finding-Nemo,DORY,The second line's '42 Wallaby Way'!
5702,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,That's great! Speed read! Take a guess! No pressure! No problem! There's a lot of pressure! Pressure! Take a guess now with pressure!
5703,Finding-Nemo,DORY,'Sydney'. It's 'Sydney'!
5704,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Duck!
5705,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Aaah!
5706,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I died, I'm dead."
5707,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Whoo-hoo! [singing] We did it, we did it! Oh yeah, yeah, yeah! No eating here tonight, whoo!"
5708,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Dory.
5709,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"[singing] No, no, no eating here tonight. You on a diet--"
5710,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Dory! What did the mask say?
5711,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"'P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney'. [gasps] I remember what it said! I usually forget things, but I remembered it this time!"
5712,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Whoa, whoa, wait! Where is that?"
5713,Finding-Nemo,DORY,I don't know. But who cares? I remembered!
5714,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I remembered it again!"
5715,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Mmmm...
5716,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Huh?
5717,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Nemo.
5718,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Huh?
5719,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Really?
5720,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Escape? Really?
5721,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Me?
5722,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Yeah?
5723,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Let's do it.
5724,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"I'm going to P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where are you going? I'm going to P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. If you're askin' where I'm goin'. I'll tell you that's where I'm going. It's P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where? I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way..."
5725,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Excuse me. Ex-excuse me, um, hi. Do you know how to get to--hello? W-w-w-wait! Can you tell me--hey! Hold it! Wait a minute! I'm trying to talk to you. Okay, fellas, come back here. Please, one quick question. I need to aaaaand they're gone again. [sighs]"
5726,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Why do I have to tell you over and over again? I'll tell you again. I don't get tired of it--"
5727,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Okay, all right."
5728,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Huh?
5729,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Here's the thing.
5730,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Y'know, I just, I-I think it's best if I just, if I just, carry on from here by..by myself."
5731,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Okay.
5732,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Y'know, alone."
5733,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Uh-huh.
5734,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Without, without..well, I mean, not without you. I mean, it's just that I don't want you... with me."
5735,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Huh?
5736,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,I don't wanna hurt your feelings..
5737,Finding-Nemo,DORY,You want me to leave?
5738,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Well, I mean not..yes, yeah. It's just that you know I-I just can't afford anymore delays and you're one of those fish that cause delays. And sometimes it's a good thing. There's a whole group of fish. They're..'delay fish'."
5739,Finding-Nemo,DORY,You mean..[whimper]you mean you don't..like me? [sobs]
5740,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't wanna be with you. It's a complicated emotion. Oh, don't cry. I like you."
5741,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Um, I don't remember. Were you?"
5742,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, no, no, no, no. We're just, we're..hey, do you guys know how I can get to--"
5743,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Mm-mmm-mmmm.
5744,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Oh, oh, I've seen one of those."
5745,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Wait, wait, um.."
5746,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,It's a swordfish.
5747,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Oh-oh-oh! It's on the tip of my tongue.
5748,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,[coughs up answer]Lobster.
5749,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,What?
5750,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Clam!
5751,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Oh, they're good."
5752,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Will somebody please give me directions?
5753,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Ha ha ha ha ha!
5754,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,I'm serious.
5755,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Thank you.
5756,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Oh dear. Hey, hey come back! Hey, what's the matter?"
5757,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little impressions, I am miles from home, with a fish that can't even remember her own name."
5758,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Boy, bet that's frustrating."
5759,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Yeah. Meanwhile my son is out there.
5760,Finding-Nemo,DORY,You're son Chico?
5761,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Nemo.
5762,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Right. Got it.
5763,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"But it doesn't matter, 'cause no fish in this entire ocean is gonna help me."
5764,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. Hey, guys."
5765,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"No, no, he's a good guy. Go easy on him, he's lost his son, Fabio. Any of you heard of P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?"
5766,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Oh, hey! They know Sydney!"
5767,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,[gasps]
5768,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"You wouldn't know how to get there, would you?"
5769,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Great! That's great! Dory, you did it!"
5770,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Oh, please. I'm just your little helper. Helping along, that's me."
5771,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Well, listen fellas, thank you."
5772,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Oh, you guys. You really nailed him. Bye."
5773,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Yes.
5774,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Trench, through it, not over it. I'll remember. Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, wait up, partner. Hold on. Wait! Wait-wait! I got, I gotta tell you something..whoa. Nice trench. Hello! Okay, let's go."
5775,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Bad trench, bad trench. Come on, we're gonna swim over this thing."
5776,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Whoa, whoa, partner. Little red flag goin' up. Somethin's telling me we should swim through it, not over it."
5777,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Are you even looking at this thing? It's got death written all over it.
5778,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"I'm sorry, but I really, really, really think we should swim through."
5779,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go."
5780,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Come on, trust me on this."
5781,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Trust you?
5782,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Yes, trust. It's what friends do."
5783,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Look! Something shiny!
5784,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Oh, it just swam over the trench. Come on, we'll follow it."
5785,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Okay.
5786,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Boy, sure is clear up here."
5787,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Exactly. And look at that, there's the current. We should be there in no time."
5788,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Hey, little guy."
5789,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,You wanted to go through the trench.
5790,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine and he shall be my Squishy. Come here, Squishy. Come here, little Squishy. [Baby talk]---oww!"
5791,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Dory! That's a jellyfish!
5792,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Bad Squishy! Bad Squishy!
5793,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Shoo! Shoo, shoo! Get away! Come here, let me see."
5794,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Don't touch it! Don't touch it!
5795,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,I'm not gonna touch it. I just wanna look.
5796,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Heeey, how come it didn't sting you?"
5797,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,It did. It's just that..
5798,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Ow! Ow, oww!"
5799,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"..hold still. I live in this anemone and I'm, I'm, I'm used to these kind of stings. Come here."
5800,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Ow, ow! Oww!"
5801,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"It doesn't look bad, you're gonna be fine. But now we know, don't we?"
5802,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Yeah.
5803,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,That we don't wanna touch these again. Let's be thankful this time it was just a little one.[gasps]
5804,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Don't move! This is bad, Dory."
5805,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Hey, watch this! Boing! Boing!"
5806,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,[gasps] Dory!
5807,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Boing-boing-boing! [singing] You can't catch me!
5808,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Dory! Don't bounce on the tops! They will..not sting you. The tops don't sting you, that's it!"
5809,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Ooh! Two in a row, beat that."
5810,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Dory! All right, listen to me. I have an idea, a game."
5811,Finding-Nemo,DORY,A game?
5812,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,A game.
5813,Finding-Nemo,DORY,A game?
5814,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Yes.
5815,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Aah! I love games! Pick me!
5816,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"All right, here's the game. Um, whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish, wins."
5817,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Okay!
5818,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Rules, rules, rules!"
5819,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Okay!
5820,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"You can't touch the tentacles, only the tops."
5821,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Something about tentacles, got it. On your mark, get set, go!"
5822,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"W-wait! Wait! Not something about them, it's all about them! Wait!"
5823,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Weeee!
5824,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Dory!
5825,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Gotta go faster if you wanna win!
5826,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,[gasps] Dory!
5827,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Boing! Boing! Boing-boing-boing-boing!
5828,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Wait a minute--whoa! Dory!
5829,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Weeee!
5830,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"So, we're cheating death now. That's what we're doin'. We're havin' fun at the same time. I can do this, just be careful."
5831,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win!"
5832,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Oh, I don't think so!"
5833,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Ha ha ha ha! Whooo! Give it up, old man. You can't fight evolution, I was built for speed."
5834,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"The question is, Dory, are you hungry?"
5835,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Huh? Hungry?
5836,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Yeah, 'cause you're about to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left! Right there! The clownfish is the winner! Woohoo! We did it! We're gonna...Dory? Oh no. Dory! Dory! Dory! [gasps] Dory! Uggghhh!"
5837,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Ugh...am I disqualified?
5838,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, you're doing fine! You're, you're actually winning! But you gotta stay awake. Uh, where does P. Sherman live?"
5839,Finding-Nemo,DORY,P..Sherman..Wallaby Way...Sydney...
5840,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,That's it! Oww! Ow! Stay awake! Stay awake! Ow! Stay awake! Stay--awake!
5841,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Awake...P..Sherman..
5842,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Awake...
5843,Finding-Nemo,DORY,..42 Wallaby Way...
5844,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Awake...wake up...Nemo...
5845,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Yeah.
5846,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,He's not looking for me. He's scared of the ocean.
5847,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Toilet?
5848,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Wow. How many times have you tried to get out?
5849,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Okay.
5850,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,[takes a deep breath]
5851,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Yeah.
5852,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Uh-huh.
5853,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Aaah!
5854,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,I can't do it!
5855,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Okay.
5856,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,I got it! I got it!
5857,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Oh no! Gill! Gill!
5858,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Help me!
5859,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,No! No!
5860,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,I got it!
5861,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Ooh...
5862,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Ooooh...
5863,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Ooooh..what happened?
5864,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,What're you talking about?
5865,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Ooh.
5866,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Ooh..ooh, my stomach. Ooooh.."
5867,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,So Mr. Turtle...
5868,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Crush? Really? Okay Crush, listen I need to get to the East Australian Current. EAC?"
5869,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Grabbing--waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Whooooooaaaa!!!
5870,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Stop!
5871,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Well, Dory and I need to get to Sydney. [gasps] Dory! Dory! Is she all right!?"
5872,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Dory, Dory! Dory!"
5873,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Hmm-mmm....
5874,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Oh, Dory. I-I-I'm so sorry. This is all my fault, it's my fault..."
5875,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"..29, 30! Ready or not, here I come! There you are! Catch me if you can! Ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!"
5876,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Huh?
5877,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,[gasps] Oh my goodnes!
5878,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Well, apparently, I must've done something you all like. Heh, uh, dudes."
5879,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Ow.
5880,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,All by themselves?
5881,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"But-but-but dude, how do you know when they're ready?"
5882,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Hey! Look, everybody!"
5883,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Well, go on, jump on him."
5884,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,W-w-wai-wait--
5885,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Hold on, I need to breath--"
5886,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,One at a time!
5887,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Sorry. I was a little vague on the details.
5888,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Well, you see my son was taken. My son was taken away from me."
5889,Finding-Nemo,DORY,No way.
5890,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, no, no, kids. I don't wanna talk about it."
5891,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"[sighs] Well, okay. I live on this reef, a long long way from here."
5892,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Oh, boy. This is gonna be good, I can tell."
5893,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"And my son, Nemo, see he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been so tough on him, I don't know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when he was out there, these divers appeared and I tried to stop them but the boat was too fast. So we swam out in the ocean to follow them..."
5894,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,[sighs]
5895,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"It's okay, I know who you're talking about."
5896,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Gill? Gill?
5897,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,I'm sorry I couldn't stop the--
5898,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,What? What is it?
5899,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,My father? Really?
5900,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Sharks? That can't be him.
5901,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Marlin?
5902,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,It's my dad! He took on a shark!
5903,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Really?
5904,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Yeah, I can hear you."
5905,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Ha ha ha ha!
5906,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Where!? I don't see it!
5907,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Right there! I see it! I see it!
5908,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,You mean the swirling vortex of terror!?
5909,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Of course it is.
5910,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Yes!
5911,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"It's like he's trying to speak to me, I know it! You know, you're really cute! But I don't know what you're saying! Say the first thing again!"
5912,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Whoooo!
5913,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Hey, look! Turtles!"
5914,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No worries! Thank you, dude Crush!"
5915,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Bye, everyone!"
5916,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Oh, Nemo would've loved this. Hey, ooh! Hey, Crush! Crush, I forgot! How old are you?"
5917,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Hundred and fifty! Hundred and fifty, I gotta remember that."
5918,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Whoa. We goin' in there?
5919,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Yup.
5920,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?"
5921,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Yup. We're gonna just swim straight.
5922,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"[singing] Just keep swimming, just keep swimming."
5923,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Dory?
5924,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Boy, this is taking a while."
5925,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Hey, how about we play a game?"
5926,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Okay.
5927,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Uh, okay. I'm thinking of something, uh, orange. And it's small.."
5928,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,It's me.
5929,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Right. Okay..
5930,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"..orange, and uh, small.."
5931,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,It's me.
5932,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"All righty, Mr. Smarty Pants."
5933,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"..orange and small, and white stripes.."
5934,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Me. And the next one's just a guess: me.
5935,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Okay, that's just scary."
5936,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"W-w-wait, I have definitely seen this floating speck before. That means we've passed it before and that means we're going in circles and that means we're not going straight!"
5937,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Hey. Hey!
5938,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"We gotta get to the surface, come on! Let's figure it out up there. Let's go! Follow me! Wha--?"
5939,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Relax. Take a deep breath. Now, let's ask somebody for directions."
5940,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Oh, fine. Who do you wanna ask, the speck? There's nobody here!"
5941,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Well, there has to be someone. It's the ocean, silly, we're not the only two in here. Let's see...okay, no one there. Uhh, nope. Nada. [gasps] There's somebody. Hey! Excuse--"
5942,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Dory! Dory! Dory! Okay, now it's my turn. I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious. It's a fish we don't know. And if we ask it directions, it could ingest us and spit out our bones!"
5943,Finding-Nemo,DORY,What is it with men and asking for directions?
5944,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Look, I don't wanna play the gender card right now. You wanna play a card? Let's play the 'Let's Not Die' card."
5945,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"You wanna get outta here, don't you?"
5946,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Of course, I do."
5947,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Well then, how are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot and hope for the best? Hmmm? Hmmmm!? Come on, trust me on this."
5948,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,All right.
5949,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Excuse me! Woohoo! Little fella? Hello. Don't be rude, say 'hi'."
5950,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Ha..hello.
5951,Finding-Nemo,DORY,His son Bingo..
5952,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Nemo.
5953,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"..Nemo, was taken to, uh.."
5954,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Sydney.
5955,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Dory, I'm a little fella. I don't think that's a little fella."
5956,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Oh. Oh, oh, big fella. Big fe--whale. Okay. Maybe he only speaks whale. MOOOOO-WEEEEEEE-NEEEEED..."
5957,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Uh, Dory..what're you doing?"
5958,Finding-Nemo,DORY,TOOOOOOO-FIIIIIIND...
5959,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,What're you doing?
5960,Finding-Nemo,DORY,HIS-SOOOOOOOOOOOON...
5961,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Are you sure you speak whale?
5962,Finding-Nemo,DORY,CAN-YOOOOOOOUUU-GIIIIIIIIIVE-USSSS-DIRECTIOOOOOOOONS-TOOOOOOOOO...
5963,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Dory! Heaven knows what you're saying! See, he's swimming away."
5964,Finding-Nemo,DORY,COOOME-BAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!
5965,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,He's not coming back. You offended him.
5966,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Maybe a different dialect. MOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! MOOOOOAAAAAAAAAA..!
5967,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Dory. Dory, this is not whale. You're speaking like..upset stomach."
5968,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Maybe I should try humpback.
5969,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, don't try humpback."
5970,Finding-Nemo,DORY,WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOO!!! WAAAAAAAAAOOOOOO!!!
5971,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Okay, you actually sound sick."
5972,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Maybe louder, huh? RAAAH!!! RAAAAH!!!"
5973,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Don't do that!
5974,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Too much orca. Didn't it sound a little orca-ish?
5975,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,It doesn't sound orca! It sounds like nothing I've ever heard!
5976,Finding-Nemo,DORY,MOOOO..MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
5977,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"It's just as well, he might be hungry."
5978,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Don't worry. Whales don't eat clownfish, they eat krill."
5979,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Oh, look. Krill."
5980,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Move, Dory! Move!"
5981,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Aah-aaah! Aaaaaaaaaah!
5982,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Yay! He's gonna clean the tank! He's gonna clean the tank! We're gonna be clean!
5983,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Uh-huh.
5984,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Yeah.
5985,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Ooof!
5986,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Ha~~haaa~~haaaaaaah! Whooo!
5987,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
5988,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Here comes a big one--whooooooo! Come on, you gotta try this!"
5989,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Would you just stop it!?
5990,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Why? What's wrong?
5991,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,We're in a whale! Don't you get it!?
5992,Finding-Nemo,DORY,A whale?
5993,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,A whale! 'Cause you had to ask for help! And now we're stuck here!
5994,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Wow. A whale. You know I speak whale.
5995,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, you're insane! You can't speak whale! I have to get out! I have to find my son! I have to tell him how old sea turtles are! [sobs]"
5996,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Woo-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-hoo! Hey. You okay?
5997,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"There, there. It's all right. It'll be okay."
5998,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No. No, it won't."
5999,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Sure it will, you'll see."
6000,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him.
6001,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Huh. That's a funny thing to promise.
6002,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,What?
6003,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Well, you can't never let anything happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him. Not much fun for little Harpo."
6004,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Hmm..
6005,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,What's going on?
6006,Finding-Nemo,DORY,I don't know. I'll ask him. MMMWWHAAAAAAAAA! HUUUWHAAAAAAAAA..
6007,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Dory. Dory.
6008,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,..AAAAAAAAAAT'SSS-GOOIIIIIIING..
6009,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Dory.
6010,Finding-Nemo,DORY,..OOOOOOOOONNN?
6011,Finding-Nemo,DORY,I think he says we've stopped.
6012,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Of course, we've stopped. Just stop trying to speak whale, you're gonna make things worse. [gasps] What is that noise? Oh no. Look what you did. The water's going down! It's-it's-it's going down!"
6013,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Really? You sure about that?
6014,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Look, it's already half-empty!"
6015,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Hmm..I'd say it's half full.
6016,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Stop that! It's half-empty!
6017,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Okay, that one was a little tougher. He either said we should go to the back of the throat or he wants a root beer float."
6018,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Of course he wants us to go there! That's eating us! How do I taste, Moby!? Huh!? Do I taste good!? You tell him I'm not interested in being lunch!"
6019,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Okay. HEEEEEEEEE--
6020,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Stop talking to him--waaaah!
6021,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!
6022,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,What is going on!?
6023,Finding-Nemo,DORY,I'll check! WHAAAAAAA--!
6024,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,No! No more whale! You can't speak whale!
6025,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Yes, I can!"
6026,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, you can't! You think you could do these things but you can't, Nemo!"
6027,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Okay.
6028,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Dory!
6029,Finding-Nemo,DORY,He says it's time to let go! Everything's gonna be all right!
6030,Finding-Nemo,DORY,I don't!
6031,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Ha ha ha! We're alive!
6032,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Look! Sy-d-ney..Sydney! Uh, Sydney! Sydney again!"
6033,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"You were right, Dory! We made it! We're gonna find my son!"
6034,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,THAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANK-YOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUU-SIIIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
6035,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Wow. I wish I could speak whale.
6036,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Okay. All we gotta do is find the boat that took him.
6037,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Right!
6038,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Come on, Dory. We can do this!"
6039,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,What're we gonna do?
6040,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Then what're we gonna do about--
6041,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Aaah! Oh! Gill!
6042,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Help me! Help me!
6043,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Help me!
6044,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Gill!
6045,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Gill! Don't let me go belly up!
6046,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Don't let me go belly up!
6047,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"All right, do any of these boats look familiar to you?"
6048,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, but the boat has to be here somewhere! Come on, Dory, we're gonna find it."
6049,Finding-Nemo,DORY,I'm totally excited. [yawn] Are you excited? [yawn]
6050,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Dory, wake up, wake up. Come on."
6051,Finding-Nemo,DORY,[gasps] Duck!
6052,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,That's not a duck. It's a--pelican! Whooooaaaaah!
6053,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
6054,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,No! I didn't come this far to be breakfast!
6055,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!
6056,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,I gotta find my son Nemo!
6057,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Dory, keep going! He's crazy!"
6058,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Hop in your mouth, huh? And how does that make me live?"
6059,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Yeah, right."
6060,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,That's Nemo!
6061,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!
6062,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Whoooooo! Woohooooo!
6063,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Ha-haaaa! Ha ha ha ha!
6064,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
6065,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Where's Nemo!? Where is he!?
6066,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Oh yes, you can! Charge!"
6067,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,[gasps] Nemo.
6068,Finding-Nemo,DORY,[gasps] Oh my goodness.
6069,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Nemo!
6070,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Daddy?
6071,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Daddy!?
6072,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Gill.
6073,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Daddy!
6074,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Hey..
6075,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Dory. If it wasn't for you, I never even would have made it here. So, thank you."
6076,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Hey! Hey, wait a minute. W-w-wait! Where are you going?"
6077,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"It's over, Dory. We were too late. Nemo's gone and I'm going home now."
6078,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"No..no, you can't! Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long before. And if you leave, if you leave...I just, I remember things better with you. I do. Look, P. Sherman, 42..40..2..agh! I remember it, I do. It's there, I know it is because when I look at you, I can feel it. And I, I look at you and...I'm home. Please. I don't want them to go away. I don't wanna forget."
6079,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"I'm sorry, Dory, but I do."
6080,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Hey, have you seen my dad?"
6081,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Dad! Dad! Dad!
6082,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Aah! No!
6083,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Um, excuse me. Are you all right?"
6084,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"I don't know where I am! I don't know what's going on, I think I lost somebody but I, I can't remember."
6085,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"It's okay, it's okay. I'm looking for someone too. Hey, we can look together."
6086,Finding-Nemo,DORY,I'm Dory.
6087,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,I'm Nemo.
6088,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Nemo? That's a nice name.
6089,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Dad!
6090,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Dad!
6091,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Dad!
6092,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Dad! Wait a minute, is it your dad or my dad?"
6093,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,My dad.
6094,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Got it. Dad!
6095,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Where are we, anyway?"
6096,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Dad! Dad! Oh. S-ss-syl--shi--Sydney. [gasps] 'P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney'."
6097,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Aaaaah! Nemo! It's you! Aaaaaah! You're Nemo!
6098,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,[muffled] Yes! Yes! I'm Nemo!
6099,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Oh! You're Nemo! [gasps] You were dead! I saw you! And then I--[gasps], here you are! I found you! You're not dead! And your father--[gasps]! Your father!"
6100,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,My father!? You know my father!? Where is he!?
6101,Finding-Nemo,DORY,[gasps] This way! He went this way! Quick!
6102,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Hey! Hey, hey! Hey!"
6103,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Hey! Have you seen an orange fish swim by? It looks just like him!
6104,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,But bigger!
6105,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Sorry. Just trying to get home.
6106,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Dad! Dad!
6107,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Nemo?
6108,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Daddy!
6109,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Nemo?
6110,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Dad!
6111,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Nemo's alive!
6112,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Dory? [gasps] Nemo!
6113,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Daddy!
6114,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo!"
6115,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Dad!
6116,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Nemo!
6117,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Dad!
6118,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Oh, thank goodness! It's all right, son. It's gonna be okay."
6119,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Look out!
6120,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Move! Move!
6121,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Help! AAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
6122,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Dory!
6123,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Come on!
6124,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Heeeeeeeelp!!! Help!
6125,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Dory!
6126,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Help! Get us out! Aaaaaaaah!
6127,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, no, no! No! Dory!"
6128,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Dad! I know what to do!
6129,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Nemo! No!
6130,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,We have to tell all the fish to swim down together!
6131,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Get out of there, now!"
6132,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,I know this will work!
6133,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, I am not gonna lose you again!"
6134,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Dad, there's no time! It's the only way we can save Dory! I can do this!"
6135,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,You're right. I know you can.
6136,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Lucky fin!
6137,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Now go! Hurry!
6138,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Tell all of the fish to swim down!
6139,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Well!? You heard my son! Come on!
6140,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Dory!
6141,Finding-Nemo,DORY,[gasps]
6142,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,You have to tell everybody to..
6143,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,..swim down together! Do you understand what I'm saying to you!? Swim down!
6144,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Everybody swim down!
6145,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Come on! You have to swim down!
6146,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Swim down, okay?"
6147,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Swim..
6148,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,down! Swim down! Swim down! Swim down!
6149,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Don't give up! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming!
6150,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,It's working!
6151,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Just keep swimming! Keep swimming!
6152,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Come on, dad!"
6153,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"You're doing great, son!"
6154,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,That's my dad!
6155,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Come on! Let's get to the bottom! Keep swimming!
6156,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"[singing] Just keep swimming, just keep swimming."
6157,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Almost there! Keep swimming!
6158,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Oww!
6159,Finding-Nemo,DORY,Hey!
6160,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Dory! Where's Nemo!?
6161,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Oh no. Nemo!
6162,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Nemo? Nemo? It's okay. Daddy's here, daddy's got you."
6163,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,[coughs] Daddy?
6164,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Oh, thank goodness."
6165,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Dad...I don't hate you.
6166,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"No, no, no. I'm so sorry, Nemo."
6167,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Hey, guess what?"
6168,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,What?
6169,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Sea turtles? I met one! And he was a hundred and fifty years old.
6170,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Hundred and fifty?
6171,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Yep.
6172,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,'Cause Sandy Plankton said they only live to be a hundred.
6173,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Sandy Plankton? Do you think I would cross the entire ocean and not know as much as Sandy Plankton!?
6174,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Ha ha ha ha!
6175,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,He was a hundred and fifty! Not one hundred! Who is this Sandy Plankton who knows everything?
6176,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Time for school! Time for school! Get up! Let's go! Go!
6177,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,I'm gonna win!
6178,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"No, you're not! I did it! Woohoo! Ha ha ha!"
6179,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Oh! My own son beats me!
6180,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"So just then, the sea cucumber looks over to the mollusk and says : 'with fronds like these, who needs anemones?'!"
6181,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,Exchange student.
6182,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Thanks, guys."
6183,Finding-Nemo,DORY,..not food! Bye!
6184,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Bye, son! Have fun!"
6185,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Bye, dad! Oh! Oh, Mr. Ray! Wait. I forgot something."
6186,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Love you, dad."
6187,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"I love you too, son."
6188,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"Uh, dad, you can let go now."
6189,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Sorry! Now go have an adventure!
6190,Finding-Nemo,DORY,"Bye, Elmo!"
6191,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,Nemo.
6192,Finding-Nemo,NEMO,"See you after school, Dory! Bye, dad!"
6193,Finding-Nemo,MARLIN,"Bye, son."
6194,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Hello. My name's Forrest Gump.
6195,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,You want a chocolate?
6196,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I could eat about a million and a half of these. My momma always said, ""Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."""
6197,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Those must be comfortable shoes. I'll bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing. I wish I had shoes like that.
6198,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Momma always says there's an awful lot you could tell about a person by their shoes. Where they're going. Where they've been.
6199,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I think about it real hard I could remember my first pair of shoes.
6200,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Momma said they'd take my anywhere.
6201,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,She said they was my magic shoes.
6202,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now, when I was a baby, Momma named me after the great Civil War hero, General Nathan Bedford Forrest..."
6203,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"She said we was related to him in some way. And, what he did was, he started up this club called the Ku Klux Klan. They'd all dress up in their robes and their bedsheets and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something. They'd even put bedsheets on their horses and ride around. And anyway, that's how I got my name. Forrest Gump."
6204,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Momma said that the Forrest part was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that, well, just don't make no sense."
6205,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Momma always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them.
6206,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"We lived about a quarter mile of Route 17, about a half mile from the town of Greenbow, Alabama. That's in the county of Greenbow. Our house had been in Momma's family since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come across the ocean about a thousand years ago. Something like that."
6207,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Since it was just me and Momma and we had all these empty rooms, Momma decided to let those rooms out. Mostly to people passing through. Like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, place like that. That's how me and Mommy got money. Mommy was a real smart lady."
6208,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"She wanted me to have the finest education, so she took me to the Greenbow County Central School. I met the principal and all."
6209,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Momma, what's vacation mean?"
6210,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Where Daddy went?
6211,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Anyway, I guess you could say me and Momma was on our own."
6212,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,But we didn't mind. Our house was never empty. There was always folks comin' and goin'.
6213,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Sometimes we had so many people stayin' with us that every room was filled with travelers. You know, folks livin' out of their suitcases, and hat cases, and sample cases."
6214,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"One time a young man was staying with us, and he had him a guitar case."
6215,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I liked that guitar.
6216,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,It sounded good.
6217,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I started moving around to the music, swinging my hips. This one night me and Momma..."
6218,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"...was out shoppin', and we walked right by Benson's Furniture and Appliance store, and guess what."
6219,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Some years later, that handsome young man who they called ""The King,"" well, he sung too many songs, had himself a heart attack or something."
6220,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Must be hard being a king. You know, it's funny how you remember some things, but some things you can't."
6221,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I sure will, Momma."
6222,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I remember the bus ride on the first day of school very well.
6223,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Momma said not to be taking rides from strangers.
6224,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I'm Forrest Gump.
6225,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Well, now we ain't strangers anymore."
6226,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"You know, it's funny what a young man recollects. 'Cause I don't remember being born."
6227,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I, I... don't recall what I got for my first Christmas and I don't know when I went on my first outdoor picnic. But, I do remember the first time I heard the sweetiest voice..."
6228,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...in the wide world.
6229,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life. She was like an angel.
6230,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Well, are you gonna sit down, or aren't ya?"
6231,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,What's wrong with your legs?
6232,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Um, nothing at all, thank you. My legs are just fine and dandy."
6233,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I just sat next to her on that bus and had conversation all the way to school.
6234,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Then why do you have those shoes on?
6235,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,My momma said my back's crooked like a question mark. These are going to make me as straight as an arrow. They're my magic shoes.
6236,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And next to Momma, no one ever talked to me or asked me questions."
6237,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Are you stupid or something.
6238,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Mommy says stupid is as stupid does.
6239,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,I'm Jenny.
6240,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I'm Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump.
6241,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"From that day on, we was always together. Jenny and me was like peas and carrots."
6242,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,She taught me how to climb...
6243,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Come on, Forrest, you can do it."
6244,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...I showed her how to dangle.
6245,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"""...a good little monkey and..."""
6246,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,She helped me to learn how to read.
6247,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And I showed her to swing.
6248,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Sometimes we'd just sit out and wait for the stars.
6249,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Momma's gonna worry about me.
6250,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Just stay a little longer.
6251,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"For some reason, Jenny didn't never want to go home."
6252,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Okay, Jenny. I'll stay."
6253,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,She was my most special friend.
6254,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,My only friend.
6255,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now, my Momma always told me that miracles happen every day. Some people don't think so, but they do."
6256,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Just run away, Forrest."
6257,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Run, Forrest!"
6258,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Run away! Hurry!
6259,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Run, Forrest! Run!"
6260,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Run, Forrest!"
6261,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Run, Forrest! Run!"
6262,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now, you wouldn't believe it if I told you."
6263,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,But I can run like the wind blows.
6264,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"From that day on, if I was going somewhere, I was running!"
6265,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now remember how I told you that Jenny never seemed to want to go home? Well, she lived in a house that was as old as Alabama. Her Momma had gone up to heaven when she was five and her daddy was some kind of a farmer."
6266,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Jenny? Jenny?
6267,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"He was a very lovin' man. He was always kissing and touchin' her and her sisters. And then this one time, Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school."
6268,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Jenny, why didn't you come to school today?"
6269,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Hsh! Daddy's takin' a nap.
6270,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Come on!
6271,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me."
6272,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, far, far away from here. Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, far, far away from here."
6273,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Momma always said that God is mysterious.
6274,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day. Instead...
6275,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"...he had the police say Jenny didn't have to stay in that house no more. She went to live with her grandma just over on Creekmore Avenue, which made me happy 'cause she was so close."
6276,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Some nights, Jenny'd sneak out and come over to my house, just 'cause she said she was scared. Scared of what, I don't know..."
6277,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"...but I think it was her grandma's dog. He was a mean dog. Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends..."
6278,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...all the way to high school.
6279,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Quit it!
6280,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Run, Forrest, run!"
6281,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Run, Forrest!"
6282,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Run, Forrest! Run!"
6283,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Run, Forrest!"
6284,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now, it used to be, I ran to get where I was goin'. I never thought it would take me anywhere."
6285,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And can you believe it? I got to go to college, too."
6286,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now, maybe it was just me but college was very confusing times."
6287,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Earl, what's going on?"
6288,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Coons? When raccoons try to get on our back porch, Momma just chase 'em off with a broom."
6289,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,With us? They do?
6290,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Ma'am, you dropped your book. Ma'am."
6291,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"A few years later, that angry little man at the schoolhouse door thought it would be a good idea, and ran for President."
6292,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"But, somebody thought that it wasn't."
6293,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,But he didn't die.
6294,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Is it the number 9?
6295,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,It was nice talkin' to you.
6296,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Did you go to a girls' college, or to a girls' and boys' together college?"
6297,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,'Cause Jenny went to a college I couldn't go to. It was a college just for girls.
6298,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"But, I'd go and visit her every chance I got."
6299,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Ouch! That hurts.
6300,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Forrest! Forrest! Forrest, stop it! Stop it!"
6301,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,What are you doing?
6302,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,He was hurtin' you.
6303,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"No, he's not!"
6304,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Get over there!
6305,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Billy, I'm sorry."
6306,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Don't... Wait a second!
6307,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Don't go! Billy, wait a second!"
6308,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,He doesn't know any better!
6309,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Forrest, why'd you do that?"
6310,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I brought you some chocolates. I'm sorry. I'll go back to my college now.
6311,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Forrest, look at you! Come on. Come on."
6312,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Is this your room?
6313,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Shh!
6314,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Do you ever dream, Forrest, about who you're gonna be?"
6315,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Who I'm gonna be?
6316,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Yeah.
6317,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Aren't I going to be me?
6318,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Well, you'll always be you, just another kind of you. You know? I want to be famous."
6319,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"I want to be a singer like Joan Baez. I just want to be an empty stage with my guitar, my voice... just me."
6320,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"And I want to reach people on a personal level. I want to be able to say things, just one-to-one."
6321,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?"
6322,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I sit next to them in my home economics class all the time.
6323,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Ohh... Oh... I'm sorry. Sorry.
6324,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,It's okay.
6325,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,It's all right.
6326,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,It's okay.
6327,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Oh, I'm dizzy."
6328,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,I bet that never happened in home ec.
6329,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,No.
6330,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I think I ruined your roommate's bathrobe.
6331,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"I don't care. I don't like her, anyway."
6332,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,College ran by real fast 'cause I played so much football.
6333,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,They even put me on a thing called the All-America Team where you get to meet the President of the United States.
6334,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now, the real good thing about meeting the President of the United States is the food."
6335,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"They put you in this little room with just about anything you'd want to eat or drink. And since number one, I wasn't hungry, but thirsty..."
6336,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"...and number two, they was free, I musta drank me about fifteen Dr. Peppers."
6337,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I gotta pee.
6338,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Sometime later, for no particular reason, somebody shot that nice young President when he was ridin' in his car."
6339,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And a few years after that...
6340,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"...somebody shot his little brother, too, only he was in a hotel kitchen."
6341,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,It must be hard being brothers. I wouldn't know.
6342,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now can you believe it? After only five years of playing football, I got a college degree."
6343,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Momma was proud.
6344,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Thought?
6345,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Hello, I'm Forrest..."
6346,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...Forrest Gump.
6347,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"At first, it seemed like I made a mistake."
6348,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...seeing how it was my induction day and I was already gettin' yelled at.
6349,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I didn't know who I might meet or what they might ask.
6350,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"No, but I been on a real big boat."
6351,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,My name's Forrest Gump. People call me Forrest Gump.
6352,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"So Bubba was from Bayou La Batre, Alabama, and his momma cooked shrimp."
6353,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And her momma before her cooked shrimp.
6354,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And her momma before her momma cooked shrimp, too. Bubba's family knew everything..."
6355,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...there was to know about the shrimpin' business.
6356,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Okay.
6357,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"To do whatever you tell me, Drill Sergeant!"
6358,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now, for some reason, I fit in the Army like one of them round pegs. It's not really hard. You just make your bed real neat and remember to stand up straight."
6359,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And always answer every question with ""Yes, Drill Sergeant!"""
6360,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Done, Drill Sergeant!"
6361,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"You told me to, Drill Sergeant."
6362,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Nighttime in the Army is a lovely time.
6363,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"We'd lay there in our bunks, and I'd miss my momma. And I'd miss Jenny."
6364,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Turns out, Jenny had gotten into some trouble over... some photos of her in her college sweater. And she was thrown out of school."
6365,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"But that wasn't a bad thing. Because a man who owns a theater in Memphis, Tennessee, saw those photo and offered Jenny a job singing in a show. The first chance I got, I took the bus up to Memphis to see her perform in that show."
6366,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"""Yes, and how many seas must the white dove said, before she sleeps in the sand."""
6367,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Her dream had come true. She was a folk singer.
6368,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"""Yes, how many times must the cannonballs fly before they're forever banned."""
6369,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"""The answer, my friend is blowing in the wind. The answer is blowing in..."
6370,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk! I'm singing a song here. Polly, get out here!"
6371,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Shut up! Oh, shut up!"
6372,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Forrest, what are you doing here? What are you doing?"
6373,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Come on.
6374,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"What are you doing? Forrest, let me down!"
6375,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"You can't keep doing this, Forrest. You can't keep tryin' to rescue me all the time."
6376,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,They was tryin' to grab you.
6377,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,A lot of people try to grab me. Just -- you can't keep doing this all the time!
6378,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I can't help it. I love you.
6379,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Forrest, you don't know what love is."
6380,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"You remember that time we prayed, Forrest? We prayed for God to turn me into a bird so I could fly far, far away?"
6381,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Yes, I do."
6382,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,You think I can fly off this bridge?
6383,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"What do you mean, Jenny?"
6384,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Nothing.
6385,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,I gotta get outta here.
6386,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,But wait. Jenny!
6387,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Forrest, you stay away from me, okay? You just stay away from me, please."
6388,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Can I have a ride?
6389,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,I don't care.
6390,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"So bye-bye, Jenny. They sendin' me to Vietnam. It's this whole other country."
6391,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Just hang on a minute.
6392,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Listen, you promise me something, okay? Just if you're ever in trouble, don't try to be brave, you just run, okay? Just run away."
6393,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Okay. Jenny, I'll write you all the time."
6394,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And just like that.
6395,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...she was gone.
6396,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now, they told us that Vietnam was gonna be very different from the United Sates of America."
6397,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Except for all the beer cans and the barbecue, it was."
6398,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"No, we are not relations, sir."
6399,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Lt. Dan sure knew his stuff. I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant. He was from a long, great military tradition. Somebody in his family had fought and died in every single American war."
6400,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I guess you could say he had a lot to live up to.
6401,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I sure hope I don't let him down.
6402,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I got to see a lot of countryside. We would take these real long walks.
6403,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"It wasn't always fun. Lt. Dan always gettin' these funny feelings about a rock or a trail, or the road, so he'd tell you to get down, shut up!"
6404,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,So we did.
6405,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now, I don't know much about anything, but I think some of American's best young men served in this war. There was Dallas, from Phoenix. Cleveland, he was from Detroit."
6406,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And Tex was, well, I don't remember where Tex come from."
6407,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,The good thing about Vietnam is there was always someplace to go.
6408,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And there was always something to do.
6409,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"One day it started raining, and it didn't quit for four months."
6410,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,We been through every kind of rain there is. Little bitty stingin' rain...
6411,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...and big ol' fat rain.
6412,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Rain that flew in sideways.
6413,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And sometimes rain even seemed to come straight up from underneath.
6414,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Shoot, it even rained at night."
6415,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Hey Bubba...
6416,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Okay.
6417,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,That's a fine idea.
6418,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Bubba did have a fine idea.
6419,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I even wrote Jenny and told her all about it. I sent her letters. Not every day, but almost. I told her what I was doin' and asked her what she was doing, and I told her how I thought about her always."
6420,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And how I was looking forward to getting a letter from her just as soon as she had the time I'd always let her know that I was okay.
6421,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Then I'd sign each letter, ""Love, Forrest Gump."""
6422,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"This one day, we was out walking, like always, and then, just like that, somebody turned off the rain and the sun come out."
6423,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I ran and ran, just like Jenny told me to."
6424,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I ran so far and so fast that pretty soon I was all by myself, which was a bad thing."
6425,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Bubba!
6426,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Bubba was my best good friend. I had to make sure he was okay.
6427,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Bubba?
6428,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And on my way back to find Bubba, well, there was this boy laying on the ground."
6429,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Tex!
6430,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Okay.
6431,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I couldn't just let him lay there all alone, scared the way he was, so I grabbed him up and run him out of there."
6432,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And every time I went back looking for Bubba, somebody else was saying, ""Help me, Forrest. Help me."""
6433,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I started to get scared that I might never find Bubba.
6434,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!"
6435,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Then it felt like something just jumped up and bit me.
6436,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Ah, something bit me!"
6437,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,To get Bubba.
6438,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I gotta find Bubba!
6439,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Bubba...
6440,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Oh, Bubba, no..."
6441,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Come on. Come on. Come here...
6442,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"If I'd a known this was gonna be the last time me and Bubba was gonna talk, I'd a thought of something better to say."
6443,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Hey, Bubba..."
6444,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,You got shot.
6445,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Then Bubba said something I won't even forget.
6446,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Bubba was my best good friend. And even I know that ain't something you can find just around the corner. Bubba was gonna be a shrimpin' boat captain, but instead he died right there by that river in Vietnam."
6447,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,That's all I have to say about that.
6448,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,A bullet?
6449,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Oh, yes sir. Bit me directly in the buttocks. They said it was a million dollar wound, but the Army must keep that money, 'cause I still ain't seen a nickel of that million dollars. The only good thing about being wounded in the buttocks..."
6450,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...is the ice cream. They gave me all the ice cream I could eat. And guess what. A good friend of mine was in the bed right next door.
6451,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice cream. Lieutenant Dan, ice cream."
6452,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I'm Forrest Gump.
6453,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"For some reason, ping pong came very natural to me."
6454,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,So I started playing it all the time.
6455,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I played ping-pong even when I didn't have anyone to play ping-pong with.
6456,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"The hospital's people said it made me look like a duck in water, whatever that means. Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play."
6457,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I played ping-pong so much, I even played it in my sleep."
6458,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Well... Yes, sir, I do."
6459,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Yo-You're still Lieutenant Dan.
6460,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Yes, sir!"
6461,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Guess what, Lieutenant Dan, they want to give me a me..."
6462,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Ma'am, what'd they do with Lieutenant Dan?"
6463,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Two weeks later, I left Vietnam."
6464,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"In the buttocks, sir."
6465,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"After that, Momma went to the hotel to lay down, so I went out for a walk to see our national capital."
6466,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"It's a good thing Momma was resting, 'cause the street was awful crowded with people looking at all the statues and monuments. And some of them people were loud and pushy."
6467,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Everywhere I went, I had to stand in line."
6468,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Okay.
6469,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"There was this man, giving a little talk. And for some reason, he was wearing an American flag for a shirt..."
6470,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"...and he liked to say the ""F"" word. A lot. ""F"" this and ""F"" that. And every time..."
6471,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"...he said ""F"" word, people, for some reason, well, they'd cheer."
6472,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,The war in Vietnam?
6473,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Well...
6474,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,There was only one thing I could say about the war in Vietnam.
6475,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...there was only one thing I could say about the war in Vietnam.
6476,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,In Vietnam war...
6477,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...and that's all I have to say about that.
6478,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,My name is Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump.
6479,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Forrest! Forrest!
6480,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Jenny!
6481,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Forrest!
6482,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Hey! Hey!
6483,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,It was the happiest moment of my life.
6484,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Jenny and me were just peas and carrots again. She showed me around, and even introduced me..."
6485,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...to some of her new friends.
6486,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Hey man, he's cool. He's cool. He's one of us. He's one of us."
6487,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,I ran into a friend.
6488,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"This is my good friend I told you about. This is Forrest Gump. Forrest, this is Wesley. Wesley and I live together in Berkeley, and he's the president of the Berkeley chapter of S.D.S."
6489,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Okay, but..."
6490,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,You are a fucking asshole!
6491,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Forrest! Quit it! Quit it! Forrest! Stop it!
6492,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Stop it!
6493,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"He should not be hitting you, Jenny."
6494,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Come on, Forrest."
6495,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Sorry I had a fight in the middle of your Black Panther party.
6496,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,He doesn't mean it when he does things like this. He doesn't.
6497,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I would never hurt you, Jenny."
6498,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"I know you wouldn't, Forrest."
6499,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I wanted to be your boyfriend.
6500,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"That uniform is a trip, Forrest. You look handsome in it. You do."
6501,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,You know what?
6502,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,What?
6503,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I'm glad we were here together in our national capitol.
6504,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Me too, Forrest. I have so much to tell you, you won't believe what's been going on..."
6505,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"We walked around all night, Jenny and me, just talkin'."
6506,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,She told me about all the travellin' she's done.
6507,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And how she'd discovered ways to expand her mind and learn how to live in harmony...
6508,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"...which must be out west somewhere, 'cause she made it all the way to California."
6509,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"""Smile on your brother, everybody get together, try to love on another right now"""
6510,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,I'll go.
6511,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I was a very special night for the two of us. I didn't want it to end.
6512,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny."
6513,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"I have to, Forrest."
6514,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,You know what I think? I think you should go home to Greenbow. Alabama!
6515,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Forrest, we have very different lives, you know."
6516,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I want you to have this.
6517,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Forrest, I can't keep this."
6518,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I got it just by doing what you told me to do.
6519,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Why're you so good to me?
6520,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,You're my girl.
6521,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,I'll always be your girl.
6522,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And just like that, she was gone out of my life again."
6523,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I thought I was going back to Vietnam, but instead, they decided the best way for me to fight communists was to play ping-pong. So I was in the Special Services, traveling around the country cheering up all them wounded veterans and showing them how to play..."
6524,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...ping-pong. I was so good that some years later...
6525,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"...the Army decided I should be on the All-American Ping-Pong Team. We were the first Americans to visit the land of China in like a million years or something like that, and somebody said that world peace was in our hands. But all I did was play ping-pong. When I got home..."
6526,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...I was national celebrity. Famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.
6527,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Well, in the land of China, people hardly got nothing at all."
6528,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And in China, they never go to church."
6529,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Some years later, that nice young man from England was on his way home to see his little boy and was signing some autographs. For no particular reason at all, somebody shot him."
6530,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Now that's Lieutenant Dan. Lieutenant Dan!
6531,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Yes sir, they sure did."
6532,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Yes, sir."
6533,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Lieutenant Dan!
6534,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Lieutenant Dan said he was living in a hotel. And because he didn't have no legs, he spent most of his time exercising his arms."
6535,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"What are you doing here in New York, Lieutenant Dan?"
6536,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I stayed with Lieutenant Dan and celebrated the holidays.
6537,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I didn't know I was supposed to be looking for him, sir."
6538,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan."
6539,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Yes, sir."
6540,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Shrimpin' boats.
6541,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I gotta buy me one of them shrimpin' boats as soon as I have some money. I made me a promise to Bubba in Vietnam, that as soon as the war was over, we'd go in partners. He'd be the captain of the shrimpin' boat and I'd be his first mate. But now that he's dead, that means that I gotta be the captain."
6542,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Yes, sir. A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan."
6543,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Okay.
6544,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump."
6545,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"It's funny, but in the middle of all that fun, I began to think about Jenny."
6546,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Wondering how she was spending her New Year's night out in California.
6547,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!"
6548,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan. She tastes like cigarettes."
6549,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I guess Lieutenant Dan figured there's some things you just can't change. He didn't want to be called crippled, just like I didn't want to be called stupid."
6550,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And wouldn't you know it...
6551,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...a few months later they invited me and the ping-pong team to visit the White House. So I went again. And I met the President of the United States again.
6552,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Only this time they didn't get us rooms in a real fancy hotel.
6553,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Yes, sir."
6554,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,It's called the Hotel Ebbott.
6555,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Yeah, sir, you might want to send a maintenance man over to that office across the way. The lights are off, and they must be looking for the fuse box or something, 'cause them flashlights they're, they're keeping me awake."
6556,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Thank you.
6557,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Good night.
6558,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Yes, sir!"
6559,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Does this mean I can't play ping pong no more?
6560,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And just like that, my service in the United States Army was over. So I went home."
6561,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I'm home, Momma."
6562,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now, when I got home, I had no idea that Momma had had all sorts of visitors."
6563,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Oh, Momma. I only like using my own paddle. Hi, Miss Louise."
6564,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"That Momma, she sure was right. It's funny how things work out."
6565,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I didn't stay home for long, because I'd made a promise to Bubba. And I always try to keep my promise. So I went on down to Bayou La Batre to meet Bubba's family and make their introduction."
6566,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue."
6567,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And of course, I paid my respect to Bubba himself."
6568,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump. I remember everything you said, and I got it all figured out."
6569,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I'm taking the twenty-four thousand, five hundred and six-two dollars and forty-seven cents that I got..."
6570,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"...well, that's left after a new hair cut and a new suit and I took Momma out to real fancy dinner and I bought a bus ticket and three Doctor Peppers."
6571,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Stupid is as stupid does, sir."
6572,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Well, that's what's left after me saying, ""When I was in China on the All-America Ping-Pong Team, I just loved playing ping-pong with my Flex- O-Ping-Pong Paddle."" Which everybody knows it isn't true, but Momma says it's just a little white lie so it wouldn't hurt nobody. So, anyway, I'm putting all that on gas, ropes and new nets and a brand-new shrimpin' boat."
6573,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now, Bubba had told me everything he knows about shrimpin', but you know what I found out? Shrimpin' is tough."
6574,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I only caught five.
6575,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I'd never named a boat before, but there was only one I could think of."
6576,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,The most beautiful name in the wide world.
6577,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny in a long while. But..."
6578,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,But I thought about her a lot. And I hoped that whatever she was doing made her happy.
6579,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I thought about Jenny all the time.
6580,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Hi!
6581,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing here?"
6582,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Well, you ain't got no legs, Lieutenant Dan."
6583,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Okay.
6584,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"No, sir."
6585,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,That's my boat.
6586,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Which way?
6587,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Okay.
6588,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan."
6589,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Well, how we gonna find them?"
6590,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,So I went to church every Sunday...
6591,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too. Though I think he left the praying up to me."
6592,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,No shrimp.
6593,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that, 'cause right then, God showed up."
6594,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now me, I was scared. But Lieutenant Dan, he was mad."
6595,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"After that, shrimpin' was easy."
6596,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And since people still needed them shrimps for shrimp cocktails and barbecues and all...
6597,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"...and we were the only boat left standing ""Bubba-Gump"" shrimp's what they got. We got a whole bunch of boats. Twelve Jenny's, a big ol' warehouse, we even have hats that says ""Bubba-Gump"" on 'em. ""Bubba- Gump Shrimp."" It's a household name."
6598,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Yes, sir. We've got more money than Davy Crocket."
6599,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Would you like to see what Lieutenant Dan looks like?
6600,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,That's him right there.
6601,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And let me tell you something about Lieutenant Dan.
6602,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"He never actually said so, but I think he made his peace with God."
6603,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Where's Momma?
6604,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"What's the matter, Momma?"
6605,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Why are you dyin', Momma?"
6606,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"You did good, Momma."
6607,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"What's my destiny, Momma?"
6608,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Momma always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them.
6609,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,She had got the cancer and died on a Tuesday. I bought her a new hat with little flowers on it.
6610,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And that's all I have to say about that.
6611,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Didn't you say you were waiting for the Number Seven bus?
6612,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now, because I had been a football star, and a war hero, and a national celebrity, and a shrimpin' boat captain, and a college graduate, the city of fathers of Greenbow, Alabama, decided to get together and offered me a fine job."
6613,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"So, I never went back to work for Lieutenant Dan."
6614,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Though he did take care of my Bubba- Gump money. He got me invested in some kind of fruit company. And so then I got a call from him saying we don't have to worry about money no more.
6615,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And I said, ""That's good. One less thing."""
6616,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now, Momma said there's only so much fortune a man really needs..."
6617,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"...and the rest is just for showing off. So, I gave a whole bunch of it to the Four Square Gospel Church."
6618,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital.
6619,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And even though Bubba was dead, and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts. I gave Bubba's mommy Bubba's share."
6620,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And you know what...
6621,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,She didn't have to work in nobody's kitchen no more.
6622,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And 'cause I was godzillionaire and I liked doing it so much. I cut that grass for free.
6623,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"But at nighttime, when there was nothing to do and the house was all empty, I'd always think of Jenny."
6624,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And then, she was there."
6625,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Hello, Forrest."
6626,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Hello, Jenny."
6627,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Jenny came back and stayed with me.
6628,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Maybe it was because she had nowhere else to go. Or maybe it was because she was so tired, because she went to bed and slept and slept like she hadn't slept in years. It was wonderful having her home."
6629,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Every day we'd take a walk, and I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree. And she'd listen about ping-pong and shrimpin' boats and Momma makin' a trip to heaven. I did all the talkin'. Jenny most of the time was real quiet."
6630,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...big ol' gobs of rain and little bitty stinging rain and rain...
6631,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,How could you do this?
6632,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Sometimes I guess there just aren't enough rocks.
6633,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I never really knew why she came back, but I didn't care. It was like olden times. We was like peas and carrots again."
6634,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Every day I'd pick pretty flowers and put them in her room for her.
6635,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And she gave me the best gift anyone could ever get in the wide world.
6636,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Okay, you can open your eyes."
6637,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,New shoes.
6638,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,They make them just for running.
6639,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And she even showed me how to dance. And, well, we was like family... Jenny and me."
6640,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And it was the happiest time of my life.
6641,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,You done watching it?
6642,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Mm-hmm.
6643,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,I'm going to bed.
6644,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Will you marry me? I'd make a good husband, Jenny."
6645,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"You would, Forrest."
6646,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,But you won't marry me.
6647,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,You don't want to marry me.
6648,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Why don't you love me, Jenny? I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is."
6649,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Jenny?
6650,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Forrest, I do love you."
6651,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,I'm not running.
6652,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"That day, for no particular reason, I decided to go for a little run."
6653,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"So I ran to the end of the road, and when I got there, I thought maybe I'd run to the end of town."
6654,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And when I got there...
6655,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"...I thought maybe I'd just run across Greenbow County. And I figured since I run this far, maybe I'd just run across the great..."
6656,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...state of Alabama. And that's what I did I ran clear across Alabama.
6657,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"For no particular reason, I just kept on going. I ran clear to the ocean."
6658,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And when I got there, I figured since I'd gone this far, I might as well turn around, just keep on going."
6659,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"When I got to another ocean, I figured since I've gone this far, I might as well just turn back, keep right on going."
6660,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"When I got tired, I slept. When I got hungry, I ate."
6661,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"When I had to go, you know, I went."
6662,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Yeah.
6663,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I'd think a lot about Momma and Bubba, and Lieutenant Dan, but most of all, I thought about Jenny. I thought about her a lot."
6664,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,I'll be damned. Forrest...
6665,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,They just couldn't believe that somebody would do all that running for no particular reason.
6666,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I just felt like running.
6667,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I just left like running.
6668,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Now, for some reason what I was doing seemed to make sense to people."
6669,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"So, I got company."
6670,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And after that I got more company. And then...
6671,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...even more people joined in. Somebody later told me...
6672,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"...it gave people hope. Now... Now, I don't know anything about that, but..."
6673,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Some of those people asked me if I could help them out.
6674,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,It happens.
6675,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Sometimes.
6676,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And some years later I heard that fella did come up with a bumper sticker slogan...
6677,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...and he make a lot of money off of it.
6678,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Another time I was running along, somebody who had lost all his money in the T-shirt business, and he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt, but he couldn't draw that well and he didn't have a camera."
6679,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Have a nice day.
6680,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And some years later I found out that that man did come up with a idea for a T-shirt and he made a lot of money off of it.
6681,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Anyway, like I was saying, I had a lot of company. My Momma always said you got to put the past behind you before you can move on. And I think that's what my running was all about. I had run for three years, two months, fourteen days, and sixteen hours."
6682,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I'm pretty tired. I think I'll go home now.
6683,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And just like that, my running days was over. So, I went home to Alabama."
6684,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Oh, thank you, Miss, Miss Louise."
6685,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"One day, out of the blue clear sky, I got a letter from Jenny..."
6686,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"...wondering if I could come down to Savannah to see her, and that's what I'm doing here. She saw me on TV, running, I'm supposed to go on the Number Nine bus to Richmond Street and get off and go one block left to 1-9-4-7 Henry Street, Apartment 4."
6687,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Down that way?
6688,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,It was nice talking' to you.
6689,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Hey! Forrest! How you doing?
6690,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Hi.
6691,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Come in. Come in.
6692,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I got your letter.
6693,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Oh, I was wondering about that."
6694,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Is this your house?
6695,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Yeah, it's messy right now. I just got off work."
6696,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,It's nice. You got air conditioning.
6697,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Ah...
6698,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Thank you.
6699,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I ate some.
6700,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Hey, I kept, I kept a scrapbook of your, of your clippings and everything. There you are. This, I got your running."
6701,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I ran a long way. For a long time.
6702,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"There. Listen, Forrest. I don't know how to say this. Um, I just... I want to apologize for anything that I ever did to you, 'cause I was messed up for a long time, and..."
6703,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Hey.
6704,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Hey, you. This is an old friend from Alabama."
6705,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Ah, listen, next week my schedule changes, so I'll be able to... but thanks for picking up."
6706,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Okay.
6707,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Thanks. This is very good friend, Mr. Gump. Can you say hi to him?"
6708,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Hello.
6709,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Yes, you can. Just keep it low."
6710,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"You're a momma, Jenny."
6711,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,I'm a momma. His name is Forrest.
6712,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Like me.
6713,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,I named him after his Daddy.
6714,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"He got a daddy named Forrest, too?"
6715,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"You're his daddy, Forrest."
6716,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Hey, Forrest, look at me. Look at me, Forrest. There's nothing you need to do, okay? You didn't do anything wrong. Okay?"
6717,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Isn't he beautiful?
6718,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"He's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. But... is, is he smart, or is he..."
6719,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,He's very smart. He's one of the smartest in his class.
6720,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him."
6721,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,What are you watching.
6722,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Forrest, I'm sick."
6723,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"What, do you have a cough due to cold?"
6724,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"I have some kind virus. And the doctors don't, they don't know what it is. And there isn't anything they can do about it."
6725,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"You could come home with me. Jenny, you and little Forrest could come stay at my house in Greenbow. I'll take care of you if you're sick."
6726,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Would you marry me, Forrest?"
6727,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Okay.
6728,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Hi. Your tie.
6729,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Lieutenant Dan? Lieutenant Dan!
6730,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,You got new legs. New legs!
6731,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Magic legs.
6732,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Lieutenant Dan!
6733,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny."
6734,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Hey, it's nice to meet you, finally."
6735,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Hey.
6736,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,Hey.
6737,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,"Hey, Forrest, were you scared in Vietnam?"
6738,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Yes. Well, I, I don't know."
6739,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Sometimes it would stop raining long enough for the stars to come out. And then it was nice. It was like just before the sun goes to bed down on the bayou...
6740,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,There was over a million sparkles on the water. Like that mountain lake.
6741,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"It was so clear, Jenny. It looks like there were two skies, one on top of the other. And then in the desert, when the sun comes up..."
6742,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I couldn't tell where heavens stopped and the earth began. It was so beautiful.
6743,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,I wish I could have been there with you.
6744,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,You were.
6745,Forrest-Gump,JENNY,I love you.
6746,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,You died on a Saturday morning.
6747,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And I had you placed here under our tree.
6748,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,And I had that house of your father's bulldozed to the ground.
6749,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Momma...
6750,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...always said dyin' was a part of life.
6751,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"I sure wish it wasn't. Little Forrest, he's doing just fine."
6752,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"About to start school again soon. I make his breakfast, lunch, and dinner..."
6753,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,...every day. I make sure he combs his hair and brushes his teeth every day. Teaching him how to play ping pong.
6754,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Okay...
6755,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,He's really good.
6756,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Forrest, you go."
6757,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,We fish a lot.
6758,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"And every night, we read a book. He's so smart, Jenny. You'd be so proud of him. I am. He, uh, wrote a letter, and he says I can't read it. I'm not supposed to, so I'll just leave it here for you."
6759,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Jenny, I don't know if Momma was right or if, if it's Lieutenant Dan. I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe both is happening at the same time. I miss you, Jenny. If there's anything you need, I won't be far away."
6760,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Here's your bus. Okay.
6761,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Hey, I know this."
6762,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,My favorite book.
6763,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,Well...
6764,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"...okay. Hey, there you go."
6765,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,"Hey, Forrest. Don't... I wanted to tell you I love you."
6766,Forrest-Gump,FORREST,I'll be right here when you get back.
6767,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Elsa. Psst. Elsa! Psst.
6768,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
6769,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"Anna, go back to sleep."

6832,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Princess Anna of Arendelle.
6833,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Hi...again.
6834,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Ha. This is awkward. Not you're awkward, but just because we're-- I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. Wait, what?"
6835,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"No. No-no. It's fine. I'm not THAT Princess. I mean, if you'd hit my sister Elsa, that would be-- yeash! `Cuz, you know... Hello. FROZEN - J. Lee"

6841,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Hi me...? Oh. Um. Hi.
6842,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,...You look beautiful.
6843,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Thank you. You look beautifuller. I mean, not fuller. You don't look fuller, but more beautiful. FROZEN - J. Lee"
6844,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Thank you.
6845,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"So, this is what a party looks like?"
6846,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,It's warmer than I thought.
6847,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,And what is that amazing smell?
6848,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Thank you...only I don't dance. FROZEN - J. Lee
6849,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,But my sister does.
6850,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,What?
6851,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Oh, I don't think--"
6852,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Sorry.
6853,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Ow. Ow.
6854,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...No. FROZEN - J. Lee
6855,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"Well, he was sprightly."
6856,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Especially for a man in heels.
6857,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Are you okay?
6858,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I've never been better. This is so nice. I wish it could be like this all the time.
6859,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Me too....
6860,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,But it can't.
6861,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Why not? If--
6862,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,It just can't. FROZEN - J. Lee
6863,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Excuse me for a minute.
6864,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Hans.
6865,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I often had the whole parlor to myself to slide... Oops. Sorry.
6866,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...Your physique helps I'm sure.
6867,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"I was born with it, although I dreamt I was kissed by a troll."
6868,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Yeah, the whole thing! You got it."
6869,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Okay wait, wait. So you have how many brothers?"
6870,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,That's horrible.
6871,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"...And sisters. Elsa and I were really close when we were little. But then, one day she just shut me out, and I never knew why."
6872,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Okay, can I just say something crazy?"
6873,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,ALL MY LIFE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF
6874,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,BUT WITH YOU-
6875,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I SEE YOUR FACE.
6876,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,WITH YOU!
6877,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,WITH YOU!
6878,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,What? FROZEN - J. Lee
6879,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,SANDWICHES!
6880,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I'VE NEVER MET SOMEONE-
6881,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,AND I-
6882,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,JUST-
6883,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,SAY GOODBYE-
6884,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,WITH YOU!
6885,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,WITH YOU!
6886,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,DOOR.
6887,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Can I just say something even crazier? Yes.
6888,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Oops! Pardon. Sorry. Can we just get around you there? Thank you. Oh, there she is. Elsa!"
6889,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I mean...Queen.... Me again. Um. May I present Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.
6890,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,We would like--
6891,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,--of--
6892,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Marriage...?
6893,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Yes!
6894,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"I'm sorry, I'm confused."
6895,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Well, we haven't worked out all the details ourselves. We'll need a few days to plan the ceremony. Of course we'll have soup, roast, and ice cream and then-- Wait. Would we live here?"
6896,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Here? FROZEN - J. Lee
6897,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Anna--
6898,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Oh, we can invite all twelve of your brothers to stay with us--"
6899,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"What? No, no, no, no, no."
6900,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Of course we have the room. I don't know. Some of them must--
6901,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Wait. Slow down. No one's brothers are staying here. No one is getting married.
6902,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Wait, what?"
6903,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"May I talk to you, please. Alone."
6904,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"No. Whatever you have to say, you- you can say to both of us."
6905,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Fine. You can't marry a man you just met.
6906,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,You can if it's true love.
6907,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"Anna, what do you know about true love?"
6908,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,More than you. All you know is how to shut people out.
6909,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no. Now, excuse me. FROZEN - J. Lee"
6910,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"No, you may not. And I-I think you should go."
6911,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,The party is over. Close the gates.
6912,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"What? Elsa, no. No, wait!"
6913,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Give me my glove!
6914,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Elsa, please. Please. I can't live like this anymore."
6915,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,...Then leave.
6916,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...What did I ever do to you?!
6917,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"Enough, Anna."
6918,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,No. Why? Why do you shut me out?! Why do you shut the world out?! What are you so afraid of?!
6919,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"I said, enough! FROZEN - J. Lee"
6920,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Elsa...?
6921,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"Please, just stay away from me. Stay away!"
6922,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Elsa!
6923,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Elsa! Wait, please!"
6924,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Elsa, stop!"
6925,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,No.
6926,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,No.
6927,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,No.
6928,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Wait, no!"
6929,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,No. No. I'm completely ordinary.
6930,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...And my sister's not a monster.
6931,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,It was an accident. She was scared. She didn't mean it. She didn't mean any of this.... Tonight was my fault. I pushed her. So I'm the one that needs to go after her.
6932,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Bring me my horse, please."
6933,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Elsa's not dangerous. I'll bring her back, and I'll make this right."
6934,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"No, I need you here to take care of Arendelle."
6935,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I leave Prince Hans in charge!
6936,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,She's my sister; she would never hurt me. FROZEN - J. Lee
6937,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,LET IT GO. LET IT GO. CAN'T HOLD IT BACK ANYMORE.
6938,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,LET IT GO. LET IT GO. TURN AWAY AND SLAM THE DOOR. I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO
6939,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,IT'S FUNNY HOW SOME DISTANCE
6940,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,LET IT GO! LET IT GO! I AM ONE WITH THE WIND AND SKY. LET IT GO! LET IT GO! YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME CRY. HERE I STAND AND HERE I'LL STAY.
6941,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,LET THE STORM RAGE ON....
6942,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,MY POWER FLURRIES THROUGH THE AIR
6943,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,LET IT GO! LET IT GO! AND I'LL RISE LIKE THE BREAK OF DAWN. LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
6944,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,THAT PERFECT GIRL IS GONE. HERE I STAND IN THE LIGHT OF DAY. LET THE STORM RAGE ON!! THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY.
6945,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Elsa! Elsa! It's me, Anna...your sister who didn't mean to make you freeze the summer. I'm sorry. It's all my f-f-f-f-f-f-fault."
6946,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Of course, none of this would have happened if she'd just told me her secret...ha...she's a stinker."
6947,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Oh no. No. No. No. Come back. No. No. No. No.... Oooo-kay.
6948,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Snow, it had to be snow, she couldn't have had tr-tr-tropical magic that covered the f-f-fjords in white sand and warm --"
6949,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Fire! WHOA!
6950,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold..."
6951,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Wandering Oaken's Trading Post.
6952,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Ooh! And Sauna...
6953,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Oh, great. For now, how about boots. Winter boots...and dresses? FROZEN - J. Lee"
6954,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Oh. Um, I was just wondering; has another young woman, the Queen perhaps, I don't know, passed through here?"
6955,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Carrots.
6956,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Huh?
6957,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Behind you.
6958,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Oh, right. Excuse me."
6959,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,The North Mountain. FROZEN - J. Lee
6960,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,North Mountain.
6961,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Forty? No, ten."
6962,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,You want to talk about a supply and demand problem? I sell ice for a living.
6963,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Ooh, that's a rough business to be in right now. I mean, that is really... Ahem. That's unfortunate."
6964,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,...Ten's all I got. Help me out.
6965,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Okay, just tell me one thing; what was happening on the North Mountain? Did it seem magical?"
6966,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Yes! Now, back up while I deal with this crook here."
6967,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Okay. Okay, I'm- Ow! Whoa!"
6968,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"No Sven, I didn't get your carrots."
6969,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,But I did find us a place to sleep. And it's free.
6970,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"REINDEERS ARE BETTER THAN PEOPLE. SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?"
6971,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"YEAH, PEOPLE WILL BEAT YOU & CURSE YOU & CHEAT YOU. EVERY ONE OF EM'S BAD, EXCEPT YOU. Oh, thanks, Buddy. BUT PEOPLE SMELL BETTER THAN"
6972,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Nice duet.
6973,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Oh, it's just you. What do you want?"
6974,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I want you to take me up the North Mountain. FROZEN - J. Lee
6975,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,I don't take people places.
6976,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Let me rephrase that...
6977,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Umph.
6978,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Take me up the North Mountain.... Please.
6979,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Look, I know how to stop this winter."
6980,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,We leave at dawn.... And you forgot the carrots for Sven.
6981,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Ugh!
6982,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Oops. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't-- We leave now. Right now.
6983,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Hang on! We like to go fast!
6984,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I like fast!
6985,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down."
6986,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"This is fresh lacquer. Seriously, were you raised in a barn?"
6987,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Ew. No, I was raised in a castle."
6988,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"So tell me, what made the Queen go all ice-crazy?"
6989,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"...Oh well, it was all my fault. I got engaged but then she freaked out because I'd only just met him, you know, that day. And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage--"
6990,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Wait. You got engaged to someone you just met?
6991,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she got mad and then she tried to walk away, and I grabbed her glove--"
6992,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Hang on. You mean to tell me you got engaged to someone you just met?! FROZEN - J. Lee
6993,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Yes. Pay attention. But the thing is she wore the gloves all the time, so I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt."
6994,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?
6995,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Yes, they did.... But Hans is not a stranger."
6996,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Oh yeah? What's his last name?
6997,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...Of-the-Southern-Isles?
6998,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,What's his favorite food?
6999,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...Sandwiches.
7000,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Best friend's name?
7001,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Probably John.
7002,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Eye color.
7003,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Dreamy.
7004,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Foot size...?
7005,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Foot size doesn't matter.
7006,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Have you had a meal with him yet? What if you hate the way he eats? What if you hate the way he picks his nose?
7007,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Picks his nose? FROZEN - J. Lee
7008,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,And eats it.
7009,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Excuse me, sir. He's a prince."
7010,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,All men do it.
7011,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Ew. Look it doesn't matter; it's true love.
7012,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Doesn't sound like true love.
7013,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Are you some sort of love expert?
7014,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,No. But I have friends who are.
7015,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,You have friends who are love experts.... I'm not buying it.
7016,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Stop talking.
7017,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"No, no, no. I'd like to meet these--"
7018,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,I mean it. SHHH.
7019,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Sven, go. Go!"
7020,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,What are they?
7021,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Wolves. FROZEN - J. Lee
7022,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Wolves. What do we do?
7023,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,I've got this. You just...don't fall off and don't get eaten.
7024,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,But I wanna help.
7025,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,No.
7026,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Why not?
7027,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Because I don't trust your judgement.
7028,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Excuse me?!
7029,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Who marries a man she just met?
7030,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,It's true love!
7031,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Whoa.
7032,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Christopher!
7033,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,It's Kristoff! FROZEN - J. Lee
7034,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,AH!
7035,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Duck!
7036,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,You almost set me on fire!
7037,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,But I didn't.
7038,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Get ready to jump, Sven!"
7039,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,You don't tell him what to do!
7040,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,I do!
7041,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Jump, Sven!"
7042,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,...But I just paid it off.
7043,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Uh-oh. No, no, no."
7044,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"AH! NO, NO, NO!"
7045,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Grab on!
7046,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Pull, Sven! Pull!"
7047,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Whoa.... I'll replace your sled and everything in it.
7048,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,And I understand if you don't want to help me anymore.
7049,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Of course I don't want to help her anymore. In fact, this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again."
7050,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,But she'll die on her own.
7051,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,I can live with that. FROZEN - J. Lee
7052,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,But you won't get your new sled if she's dead.
7053,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,...You know sometimes I really don't like you.
7054,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Hold up. We're coming?!
7055,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"You are?! I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along."
7056,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Arendelle.
7057,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,It's completely frozen.
7058,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...But it'll be fine. Elsa will thaw it.
7059,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Will she? FROZEN - J. Lee
7060,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...Yeah. Now come on. This way to the North Mountain?
7061,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,More like this way.
7062,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I never knew winter could be so beautiful.
7063,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"YEAH...It really is beautiful, isn't it? But it's so white. You know, how about a little color? Must we bleach the joy out of it all? I'm thinking like maybe some crimson, chartreuse..."
7064,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"How `bout yellow--no, not yellow. Yellow and snow? Brrrr...no go."
7065,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Am I right? FROZEN - J. Lee
7066,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Hi!
7067,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,You're creepy.
7068,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I don't want it!
7069,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Backatchya!
7070,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Please don't drop me.
7071,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Don't!
7072,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Come on, it's just a head."
7073,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,No!
7074,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"All right, we got off to a bad start."
7075,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Ew, ew, the body!"
7076,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Wait, what am I looking at right now? Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?"
7077,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...Okay. Wait one second.
7078,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Oooh! Thank you!
7079,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,You're welcome.
7080,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Now I'm perfect.
7081,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Well, almost."
7082,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Woo! Head rush!
7083,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry! I-I, I was just.... Are you okay?"
7084,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Are you kidding me? I am wonderful! I've always wanted a nose. So cute. It's like a little baby unicorn.
7085,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"What? Hey! Whoa. Oh, I love it even more! Hah.... All right, let's start this thing over. Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I like warm hugs."
7086,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Olaf?...That's right, Olaf. FROZEN - J. Lee"
7087,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,...And you are?
7088,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Oh, um...I'm Anna."
7089,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,And who's the funky-looking donkey over there?
7090,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,That's Sven.
7091,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Uh-huh. And who's the reindeer?
7092,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...Sven.
7093,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Oh. They're--oh, okay.... Makes things easier for me."
7094,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Ha. Aw, look at him tryin' to kiss my nose. I like you, too!"
7095,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Olaf, did Elsa build you?"
7096,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Yeah. Why?
7097,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Do you know where she is?
7098,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Fascinating...
7099,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Yeah. Why? FROZEN - J. Lee
7100,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Do you think you could show us the way?
7101,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Yeah. Why?
7102,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,How does this work?
7103,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus here. Yeah, why?"
7104,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,I'll tell you why. We need Elsa to bring back summer.
7105,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Summer? Oh, I don't know why but I've always loved the idea of summer, and sun, and all things hot."
7106,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Really? I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.
7107,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Nope. But sometimes I like to close my eyes and imagine what it'd be like when summer does come.
7108,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,BEES'LL BUZZ / KIDS'LL BLOW DANDELION FUZZ / AND I'LL BE DOING WHATEVER SNOW DOES IN SUMMER. FROZEN - J. Lee
7109,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,A DRINK IN MY HAND / MY SNOW UP AGAINST THE BURNING SAND / PROB'LY
7110,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,I'LL FINALLY SEE A SUMMER BREEZE / BLOW AWAY A WINTER STORM /
7111,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,AND FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS TO SOLID WATER / WHEN IT GETS WARM.
7112,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE / WHAT MY BUDDIES ALL THINK OF ME / JUST IMAGINE HOW MUCH COOLER I'LL BE IN SUMMER . . !
7113,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,DA DA . . . DA DOO / AH BAH BAH BAH BAH BAH BOO.
7114,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"THE HOT AND THE COLD ARE BOTH SO INTENSE / PUT `EM TOGETHER, IT JUST MAKES SENSE!"
7115,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,RATDADAT DAD DADA DOO . . .
7116,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,WINTER'S A GOOD TIME TO STAY IN AND CUDDLE / BUT PUT ME IN SUMMER AND I'LL BE A...
7117,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,HAPPY SNOWMAN!
7118,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,WHEN LIFE GETS ROUGH I LIKE TO HOLD ON TO MY DREAM / OF RELAXING IN THE SUMMER SUN JUST LETTING OFF STEAM!
7119,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,OH THE SKY WILL BE BLUE / AND YOU GUYS'LL BE THERE TOO / WHEN I FINALLY DO WHAT FROZEN THINGS DO IN SUMMER!
7120,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,I'm gonna tell him.
7121,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Don't you dare.
7122,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,IN SUMMER!
7123,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"So, come on! Elsa's this way. Let's go bring back summer!"
7124,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I'm coming!
7125,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Somebody's got to tell him.
7126,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,So how exactly are you planning to stop this weather?
7127,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Oh, I am gonna talk to my sister."
7128,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,That's your plan? My ice business is riding on you talking to your sister.
7129,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Yup.
7130,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,So you're not at all afraid of her?
7131,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Why would I be?
7132,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Yeah. I bet Elsa's the nicest, gentlest, warmest person ever."
7133,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Oh, look at that. I've been impaled."
7134,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,What now? FROZEN - J. Lee
7135,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"...It's too steep. I've only got one rope, and you don't know how to climb mountains."
7136,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Says who?
7137,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,What are you doing?
7138,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...I'm going to see my sister.
7139,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,You're going to kill yourself.
7140,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,I wouldn't put my foot there.
7141,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,You're distracting me.
7142,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Or there. How do you know Elsa even wants to see you?
7143,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I'm just blocking you out cause I gotta concentrate here.
7144,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"You know, most people who disappear into the mountains want to be alone."
7145,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Nobody wants to be alone. Except maybe you--
7146,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"I'm not alone.... I have friends, remember?"
7147,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,You mean the love experts?
7148,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Yes, the love experts!"
7149,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...Please tell me I'm almost there.
7150,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here?
7151,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Hang on.
7152,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is going to solve the problem, but I found a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go."
7153,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!
7154,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Thanks! That was like a crazy trust exercise.
7155,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Whoa.
7156,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Now that's ice. I might cry. FROZEN - J. Lee
7157,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Go ahead. I won't judge.
7158,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"All right, take it easy. I gotcha."
7159,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"You stay right here, buddy."
7160,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,...Flawless.
7161,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,...Knock.... Just knock.... Why isn't she knocking...? Do you think she knows how to knock?
7162,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Ha. It opened. That's a first.
7163,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,You should probably wait out here.
7164,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,What?
7165,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything."
7166,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"But, it's a palace made of ice. Ice is my life. FROZEN - J. Lee"
7167,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Bye, Sven."
7168,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"You too, Olaf."
7169,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Me?
7170,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Just give us a minute.
7171,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Okay.
7172,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,One...two...
7173,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Elsa? It's me...Anna?!
7174,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Anna.
7175,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Elsa, you look different.... It's a good different.... And this place is amazing. FROZEN - J. Lee"
7176,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"Thank you, I never knew what I was capable of."
7177,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...I'm so sorry about what happened. If I'd known--
7178,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"No, it's okay. You don't have to apologize.... But you should probably go, please."
7179,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,But I just got here.
7180,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,...You belong in Arendelle.
7181,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,So do you.
7182,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"No, I belong here. Alone. Where I can be who I am without hurting anybody."
7183,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"...Actually, about that--"
7184,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,58...59...60.
7185,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Wait. What is that?
7186,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs."
7187,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Olaf?
7188,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,You built me. You remember that?
7189,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,And you're alive?
7190,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Um...I think so?
7191,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,He's just like the one we built as kids.... We were so close. We can be like that again.
7192,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Anna!
7193,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"No, we can't."
7194,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"Goodbye, Anna."
7195,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Elsa, wait--"
7196,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,I'm just trying to protect you.
7197,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid. Please don't shut me out again. FROZEN - J. Lee
7198,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,PLEASE DON'T SLAM THE DOOR. YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE ANYMORE.
7199,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"Anna,"
7200,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Yeah, but--"
7201,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,I know!
7202,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,JUST STAY AWAY AND YOU'LL BE SAFE FROM ME.
7203,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"ACTUALLY, WE'RE NOT."
7204,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT? FROZEN - J. Lee
7205,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I GET THE FEELING YOU DON'T KNOW?
7206,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,WHAT DO I NOT KNOW?
7207,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,ARENDELLE'S IN DEEP DEEP DEEP DEEP SNOW.
7208,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,What?
7209,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,You kind of set off an eternal winter...everywhere.
7210,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Everywhere?
7211,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"It's okay, you can just unfreeze it."
7212,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"No, I can't. I don't know how."
7213,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Sure you can. I know you can.
7214,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"CUZ FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,"
7215,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.
7216,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,WE CAN WORK THIS OUT TOGETHER. FROZEN - J. Lee
7217,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,I CAN'T CONTROL THE CURSE!
7218,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,WE'LL REVERSE THE STORM YOU'VE MADE.
7219,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"ANNA, PLEASE, YOU'LL ONLY MAKE IT WORSE!"
7220,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,DON'T PANIC.
7221,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,THERE'S SO MUCH FEAR!
7222,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,WE'LL MAKE THE SUN SHINE BRIGHT.
7223,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,YOU'RE NOT SAFE HERE!
7224,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,WE CAN FACE THIS THING TOGETHER...
7225,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,NO!
7226,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"WE CAN CHANGE THIS WINTER WEATHER, AND EVERYTHING WILL BE..."
7227,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,I CAN'T!
7228,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Anna. Are you okay? FROZEN - J. Lee
7229,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I'm okay.... I'm fine.
7230,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"Who's this? Wait, it doesn't matter. You have to go."
7231,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"No, I know we can figure this out together--"
7232,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,How? What power do you have to stop this winter? To stop me?
7233,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Anna, I think we should go."
7234,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"No. I'm not leaving without you, Elsa."
7235,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"Yes, you are."
7236,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Stop. Put us down!
7237,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,You are a lot stronger than I think you realize.
7238,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Heads up!
7239,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Olaf!
7240,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Watch out for my butt!
7241,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,It is not nice to throw people!
7242,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Uh-oh. Now you made him mad!
7243,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,...I'll distract him. You guys go.
7244,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"No, no, not you guys. FROZEN - J. Lee"
7245,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,This just got a whole lot harder.
7246,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,This way!
7247,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Ho-ho-ho!
7248,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I got him!
7249,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Whoa, stop!"
7250,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,It's a hundred foot drop.
7251,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,It's two hundred.
7252,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Ow.
7253,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,What's that for?
7254,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,I'm digging a snow anchor. FROZEN - J. Lee
7255,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Okay. What if we fall?
7256,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,There's twenty feet of fresh powder down there; it'll be like landing on a pillow.... Hopefully.
7257,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Okay, Anna. On three."
7258,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Okay. You tell me when...
7259,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,One...
7260,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...I'm ready to go....
7261,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Two...
7262,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...I was BORN ready! Yes!
7263,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Calm down.
7264,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,TREE!
7265,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Whoa! That happened.
7266,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape. FROZEN - J. Lee"
7267,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven! Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost Marshmallow back there!"
7268,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Hey. We were just talking about you. All good things, all good things."
7269,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,NO!
7270,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,This is not making much of a difference!
7271,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,WHOA!
7272,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Olaf!
7273,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Hang in there, guys!"
7274,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Wait, what?"
7275,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Aargghh!
7276,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Kristoff! FROZEN - J. Lee
7277,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Ugh. We won't.
7278,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow."
7279,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs!
7280,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Those are my legs.
7281,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Ooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt."
7282,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Oh, that feels better."
7283,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Hey, Sven! FROZEN - J. Lee"
7284,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,He found us. Who's my cute little reindeer?
7285,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Don't talk to him like that.
7286,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Here.
7287,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Whoa!
7288,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,You okay?
7289,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Thank you.
7290,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...Um.... How's your head?
7291,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Ah! Ooh!
7292,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"I mean, It's fine. Ah...I'm good. Ha. I've got a thick skull."
7293,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,I don't have a skull.... Or bones.
7294,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,...So....
7295,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Now what?
7296,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Now what? Now what?! Oh! What am I gonna do? She threw me out. I can't go back to Arendelle with the weather like this. And then there's your ice business--
7297,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice business... Worry about your hair?!"
7298,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,What? I just fell off a cliff. You should see your hair.
7299,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"No, yours is turning white."
7300,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,White? It's what?
7301,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,It's because she struck you; isn't it?
7302,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Does it look bad?
7303,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,...No.
7304,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,You hesitated.
7305,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"No, I didn't. Anna, you need help. Now, come on. FROZEN - J. Lee"
7306,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Okay! Where are we going?
7307,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,To see my friends.
7308,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,The love experts?
7309,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Love experts?!
7310,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Yes. And don't worry; they'll be able to fix this.
7311,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,How do you know?
7312,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,...Because I've seen them do it before.
7313,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,I like to consider myself a love expert.
7314,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Get it together. Control it. Don't feel. Don't feel. Don't FEEL!
7315,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Look, Sven. The sky's awake."
7316,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Are you cold?
7317,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...A little.
7318,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Wait. Come here.
7319,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Oooh.... That's nice.
7320,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"So, about my friends...well, I say friends, they're more like family.... Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven...until they took me in."
7321,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,They did?
7322,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Yeah. I don't want to scare you, they can be a little bit inappropriate...and loud...very loud...they're also stubborn at times, and a little overbearing. And heavy. Really, really heavy. FROZEN - J. Lee"
7323,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,But they're fine.. You'll get it. They mean well.
7324,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Kristoff, they sound wonderful."
7325,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Okay then....
7326,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Meet my family.
7327,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Hey, guys!"
7328,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...They're rocks.
7329,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"He's crazy. I'll distract them while you run. Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to meet you! Anna, because I love you, I insist you run. I understand you're love experts! Why aren't you running?"
7330,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Okay. Um...I'm gonna go--
7331,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Kristoff!
7332,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Kristoff's home.
7333,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Wait? Kristoff?
7334,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Ah! No. I'm gonna keep my clothes on, thank you."
7335,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Great to see you all. Where's grandpa?
7336,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Trolls? They're trolls.
7337,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,What's going on?
7338,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,I've learned to just roll with it.
7339,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Wait. Oh. Um. No.
7340,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,You've got the wrong idea. That's not why I brought her here.
7341,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Right. We're not. I'm not--
7342,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Can we just stop talking about this?! We've got a real, actual problem here."
7343,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"No, I don't."
7344,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Enough! She's engaged to someone else. Okay?!
7345,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Wait, what?!"
7346,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Anna?
7347,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,She's as cold as ice.
7348,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Grand Pabbie!
7349,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,What...? No.
7350,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"So remove it, Grand Pabbie."
7351,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,An act of true love?
7352,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans."
7353,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...Hans. FROZEN - J. Lee
7354,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Help us out, Sven."
7355,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Come on, Olaf!"
7356,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,I'm coming! Let's go kiss Hans! Who is this Hans?!
7357,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,No. Please.
7358,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Stay away!
7359,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,No....What have I done?
7360,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Why did you bring me here?
7361,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna.
7362,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Don't you see...I can't.
7363,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,You have to tell them to let me go.
7364,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Just hang in there. Come on, buddy, faster!"
7365,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,I'll meet you guys at the castle! FROZEN - J. Lee
7366,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Stay out of sight, Olaf!"
7367,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,I will!
7368,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Hello!
7369,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,I've got you.
7370,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...Are you g-gonna be okay?
7371,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Don't worry about me.
7372,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Get her warm and find Prince Hans, immediately."
7373,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Make sure she's safe!
7374,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Hans, you have to kiss me."
7375,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Now. Here we go.
7376,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Elsa struck me with her powers.
7377,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I was wrong.
7378,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,She froze my heart and only an act of true love can save me.
7379,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,What?
7380,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...You said you did.
7381,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,What are you talking about?
7382,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Hans?
7383,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Hans. No, stop. FROZEN - J. Lee"
7384,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Please.
7385,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...You're no match for Elsa.
7386,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,You won't get away with this.
7387,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Please, somebody help."
7388,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"What is it, buddy?"
7389,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Hey, watch it. What's wrong with you?"
7390,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,...I don't understand you when you talk like that. FROZEN - J. Lee
7391,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Ah! Stop it! Put me down!
7392,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"No, Sven! We're not going back!"
7393,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,She's with her true love.
7394,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Anna.
7395,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Help.
7396,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Anna. Oh no.
7397,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there.
7398,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Whoa! So this is heat.... I love it.
7399,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Ooh! But don't touch it!
7400,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"So, where's Hans? What happened to your kiss?"
7401,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I was wrong about him. It wasn't true love.
7402,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Huh. But we ran all the way here?
7403,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Please Olaf, you can't stay here; you'll melt."
7404,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,I am not leaving here until we find some other act of true love to save you.
7405,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,...Do you happen to have any ideas?
7406,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I don't even know what love is.
7407,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"That's okay, I do...."
7408,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Love is...putting someone else's needs before yours, like, you know, how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans and left you forever."
7409,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...Kristoff loves me?
7410,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you?"
7411,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Olaf, you're melting."
7412,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Some people are worth melting for.
7413,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Just maybe not right this second.
7414,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Don't worry, I've got it!"
7415,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"We're going to get through-- Oh, wait. Hang on. I'm getting something."
7416,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,It's Kristoff and Sven! They're coming back this way.
7417,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...They-they are? FROZEN - J. Lee
7418,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Wow, he's really moving fast. Huh.... I guess I was wrong. I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind."
7419,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Help me up, Olaf. Please."
7420,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"No, no, no, no, no. You need to stay by the fire and keep warm."
7421,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I need to get to Kristoff.
7422,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Why...? Oh, oh, oh, I know why."
7423,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"There's your act of true love, right there, riding across the fjords like a valiant, pungent reindeer king! Come on!"
7424,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Look out!
7425,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,We're trapped.
7426,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Slide, Anna."
7427,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,We made it!
7428,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"Come on, buddy, faster."
7429,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Kristoff!
7430,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Keep going, Anna!"
7431,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Kristoff!
7432,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Come on! Come on!
7433,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Sven? Sven!
7434,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Good boy.
7435,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Kristoff.
7436,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Anna...? Anna!
7437,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,...Just take care of my sister.
7438,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,What? No.
7439,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Kristoff.
7440,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Anna.
7441,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Elsa.
7442,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,No!
7443,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Anna!
7444,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"Oh, Anna...no...no, please no."
7445,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,Anna?
7446,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Wha-? Anna?
7447,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"Oh, Elsa."
7448,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,...You sacrificed yourself for me?
7449,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,...I love you.
7450,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart.
7451,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Love...will thaw... Love.... Of course.
7452,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Elsa?
7453,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Love.
7454,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I knew you could do it.
7455,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Hands down, this is the best day of my life...and quite possibly the last."
7456,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,"Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy. FROZEN - J. Lee"
7457,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,"Hey, my own personal flurry."
7458,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Uh. Uh. Uh.
7459,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,The only frozen heart around here is yours.
7460,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!
7461,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Pole.
7462,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Oops. Sorry.
7463,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Okay. Okay. Here we are. FROZEN - J. Lee
7464,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I owe you a sled.
7465,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Are you serious?
7466,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Yes. And it's the latest model.
7467,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,No. I can't accept this...
7468,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,You have to. No returns. No exchanges. Queen's orders. She's named you the official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.
7469,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,What? That's not a thing.
7470,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,Sure it is. And it even has a cup holder.... Do you like it?
7471,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Like it?
7472,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,I love it.... I could kiss you!
7473,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,"...I could. I mean I'd like to. I'd... may I? We me....I mean, may we? Wait, what?"
7474,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,We may. FROZEN - J. Lee
7475,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,Are you ready?
7476,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,I like the open gates.
7477,Frozen-(Disney),ELSA,We are never closing them again.
7478,Frozen-(Disney),ANNA,"What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful, but you know I don't ska--"
7479,Frozen-(Disney),KRISTOFF,Look out. Reindeer coming through! FROZEN - J. Lee
7480,Frozen-(Disney),OLAF,That's it. Glide and pivot and glide and pivot.
7481,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Egon, could you hold off on the weather balloon bit for a minute?"
7482,Ghostbusters,PETER,It's Your night to take out the trash.
7483,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Thanks, Slimer. I really needed that!"
7484,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Hey, even a half-baked false alarm sounds better than doing Egon's chores. Let's roll!"
7485,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Why? Lately even when he's with us, he's not with us."
7486,Ghostbusters,PETER,Good. Then he can hire a maid to do his share of the chores.
7487,Ghostbusters,PETER,Ray! It's six feet tall!
7488,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Thank you, Sir. We'll put out a missing chicken report right away."
7489,Ghostbusters,PETER,"This one's easy, guys. Old Zeke's been watchin' too many horror movies and eating too much greasy popcorn."
7490,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Get serious, Ray."
7491,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Look, if this is a werechicken egg,"
7492,Ghostbusters,PETER,...how come there's no PKE reading?
7493,Ghostbusters,PETER,"I'll take it. C'mon, Slimer."
7494,Ghostbusters,PETER,Werechickens.
7495,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Yo, balloon man, we've got some real work for you: How about analyzing this?"
7496,Ghostbusters,PETER,"I don't wanna hear about it, Egon. We've had a long night in a not-too-fragrant barnyard, so I'm taking a shower and hitting the sheets."
7497,Ghostbusters,PETER,Slimer! How 'bout some privacy??
7498,Ghostbusters,PETER,Monster?
7499,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Egon? Well, Slimer, I don't see anything here that looks like a monster."
7500,Ghostbusters,PETER,Holy cow!!
7501,Ghostbusters,PETER,"What'd you do to Egon, you bird-brain!"
7502,Ghostbusters,PETER,Hey!
7503,Ghostbusters,PETER,What's wrong with you guys? That thing ate Egon!
7504,Ghostbusters,PETER,"You're kidding! Come to think of it, there was a certain resemblance."
7505,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Ray, what's this have to do with Egon being a chicken?"
7506,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Sit down, Egon, we have some good news and some bad news."
7507,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Take it easy, Egon. You're gonna be fine. Hurry it up, guys!"
7508,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Come on, Ray!!"
7509,Ghostbusters,PETER,He's changing again!
7510,Ghostbusters,PETER,What happened?
7511,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Well, we hafta do something!"
7512,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Let's stop that thing before it makes drumsticks out of anyone else! Un, no offense, Egon."
7513,Ghostbusters,PETER,All quiet on the chicken front. How about down there?
7514,Ghostbusters,PETER,"It's how big? Okay, Ray, I admit you were right about these Werechickens,..."
7515,Ghostbusters,PETER,...but I definitely don't buy them growing to the size of buildings.
7516,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Ray, you were right! The chicken's here, and he's a walking high-rise!"
7517,Ghostbusters,PETER,It's heading down 34th toward the Empire State Building.
7518,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Take over, Slimer!"
7519,Ghostbusters,PETER,"So how're we gonna, put that big bird on ice, guys'"
7520,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Egon, can we freeze that big chicken with your weather balloons"
7521,Ghostbusters,PETER,Piece of cake.
7522,Ghostbusters,PETER,Lemme guess -- more chickenbane soup!
7523,Ghostbusters,PETER,"Tell me, how do I get out of this chicken outfit?"
7524,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Showtime, a-holes! It'll be here any minute!"
7525,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Which will be its loss.
7526,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Is that a rifle?
7527,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,You don't know what a rifle is?
7528,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,I thought your thing was a sword.
7529,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"We've been hired to stop an interdimensional beast from feeding on those batteries' energy, and I'm going to stop it with a sword?"
7530,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Don't look at me like I'm stupid. You're the one being all inconsistent.
7531,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"Drax, why aren't you wearing one of Rocket's aero-rigs?"
7532,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Hurts?
7533,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"If I finish this, we can listen to tunes while we work."
7534,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Blame Quill! He's the one who loves music so much!
7535,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,I agree with Drax. It's hardly important right now.
7536,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Oh, sure, okayyyy, Quill."
7537,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"No, I really agree with him."
7538,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Sure, I know."
7539,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Damn. I'm using my left eye?
7540,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,They were not looking at you funny.
7541,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Well. That's intense.
7542,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Groot, look - !"
7543,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"Get out of the way, Groot! You're going to get hurt!"
7544,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Hi.
7545,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Spit it out! Spit it out!
7546,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Disgusting.
7547,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Huh?
7548,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"Drax, no! That doesn't make -"
7549,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,What is he doing?!
7550,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"He said the skin is too thick to be pierced from the outside, so he --"
7551,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,That doesn't make sense!
7552,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,I tried to tell -- !
7553,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Its skin is the same thickness from the inside as from the out!
7554,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,I REALIZE THAT.
7555,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Gamora, there's a cut on its neck - Rocket, get it to look up."
7556,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Hey, you giant Sea Monkey, up here!"
7557,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Anulax batteries.
7558,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,That's nothing like what I just said. But they're worth thousands of units a piece. Which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them.
7559,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Just be careful what you say around these folks. They're easily offended and the cost of transgression is death.
7560,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,That's the kind of thing you might want to keep to yourself.
7561,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"I'll hold my tongue, as long as they deliver what was promised."
7562,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,I guess I prefer making people the old-fashioned way.
7563,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Yeah, I mean, if it's for research that could be pretty --"
7564,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Pretty repulsive. I'm not into that kind of casual -
7565,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"Oh, please. Your people promised something in trade for our services. Bring it and we shall gladly be on our way."
7566,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Family reunion. Yaaaay.
7567,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,She's worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.
7568,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Thank you, High Priestess Ayesha."
7569,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,My mother is from earth.
7570,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"He's... not from Missouri, that's all I know."
7571,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"You know, they told me you people were conceited douchebags. But that isn't true at all."
7572,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Oh, shit, I'm using my wrong eye again, aren't I? I'm sorry. That was meant to be behind your back."
7573,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,You're telling me. You wanna buy some batteries?
7574,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Let's get baldy back to Xandar and retrieve that bounty!
7575,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,You all right?
7576,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,That stuff about my father. Who does she think she is?
7577,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,I know you're sensitive about that.
7578,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,I'm not sensitive about it. I just don't know who he is.
7579,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Sorry if it looked like I was flirting with her. I wasn't.
7580,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,I don't care if you were.
7581,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,I think you do care. That's why I'm apologizing.
7582,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Uh huh.
7583,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Well, that is pretty hot, but--"
7584,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"All right, okay, fascinating, don't need to hear it. I get your point, I'm a dancer and Gamora is not."
7585,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,No. It's not ripe yet. And I hate you.
7586,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,A what?
7587,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,`Guardians of the Galaxy.'
7588,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Why would we be `the Gardens of the Galaxy'?
7589,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"Yeah, it would be."
7590,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,I wasn't the one who thought of it.
7591,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"No. You'll live out your days in a prison on Xandar, wishing you could."
7592,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"We got an armed Sovereign fleet, approaching from the rear."
7593,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Why would they do that?!
7594,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Dude.
7595,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,What were you thinking?!
7596,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Dude, it was really easy to steal."
7597,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,That's your defense?
7598,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Come on. You saw how that high- priestess talked down to us! I'm teaching her a lesson!
7599,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Oh! I didn't realize your motivation was altruism. A shame the Sovereign have mistaken your intentions and are trying to kill us.
7600,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Exactly.
7601,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,I WAS BEING SARCASTIC!
7602,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Oh no! You tricked me! You're supposed to use a sarcastic voice! Now I look foolish!
7603,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"SHUT UP, DRAX! You knew! You should have told us!"
7604,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Are you kidding me?
7605,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,You never listen to anything!
7606,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,None of you listens! Can we please just put the bickering on hold until after we survive the massive space battle?!
7607,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Whoa. Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.
7608,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Do not try to bro down with me right now, dude. I will fricking punch you in your fricking face."
7609,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Real nice! Resorting to violence.
7610,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,More incoming!
7611,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,GOOD! I WANT TO KILL SOME GUYS!
7612,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,You're not killing anyone. Those ships are all remotely piloted.
7613,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,What's the closest habitable planet?
7614,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,It's called Berhert.
7615,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,How many jumps?
7616,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Only one. But the access point is 47 clicks away. And it's through that Quantum Asteroid Field over there.
7617,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Lucky for us -
7618,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,I am.
7619,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,What are you doing?!
7620,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,I've been flying this rig since I was ten years old.
7621,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,I was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft!
7622,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,You were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag.
7623,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Stop it!
7624,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Quill, later on tonight you're gonna lay down in your bed and there's gonna be something squishy in your pillowcase and you're gonna be, like, `what's this?' and it's gonna be because I put a turd in there."
7625,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"You put your turd in my bed, I shave you."
7626,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Oh it won't be my turd, it will be Drax's."
7627,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"We're about to die, and this is what we're discussing?"
7628,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Groot, he's right, you have to start aiming inside the box."
7629,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Stop it.
7630,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Well, that's what you get when Quill flies."
7631,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Ow!
7632,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,There's still a Sovereign craft behind us!
7633,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Our weapons are down!
7634,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Twenty clicks to the jump.
7635,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Where's he going?
7636,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Fifteen clicks.
7637,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Ten clicks.
7638,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Five clicks!
7639,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Son-of-a-! They went around the field!
7640,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,What is that?!
7641,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Doesn't matter! That's the jump point! GO! GO!
7642,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,It's a guy.
7643,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Oh my God.
7644,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Groot, put on your seat belt!"
7645,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Prepare for a really bad -
7646,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"Either one of you could have gotten us through that field, if you had flown with what's between your ears instead of what's between your legs!"
7647,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"If what's between my legs had a hand on it, I guarantee I could have landed this ship."
7648,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"It's not funny, Peter. We almost died. Because of your arrogance."
7649,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,More like because he stoled Anulax batteries!
7650,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"No, they're not!"
7651,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"You know why I did it, Star-Munch?"
7652,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Do you?
7653,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,I'm not going to answer to `Star- Munch.'
7654,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,I DID IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO.
7655,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Dick.
7656,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,What are we even talking about this for? We just had a little man save us by blowing up fifty ships!
7657,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Like this.
7658,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,A little one-inch man saved us?
7659,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Well, if he got closer I'm sure he'd be much larger."
7660,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"That's how eyes work, you stupid raccoon."
7661,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Don't call me a raccoon!
7662,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to say `trash panda.'"
7663,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Is that better?
7664,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,It's worse.
7665,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,YOU SON-OF-A-!!
7666,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"I'm not a fool, Nebula."
7667,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,You'll attack me the moment I let you go.
7668,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,You'd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.
7669,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Who the hell are you?
7670,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Because I was a skinny kid who could squeeze into places adults couldn't, making thieving easier."
7671,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,What?
7672,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"We've been together all this time and you thought Yondu was my actual, blood relative?"
7673,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,One's blue.
7674,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,He wasn't my father. Yondu was the guy who abducted me. He'd beat the crap out of me so I'd learn how to fight and he kept me in terror threatening to eat me.
7675,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Yes.
7676,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,How'd you locate us now?
7677,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Not buying it.
7678,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"Peter, we need to take a walk."
7679,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Give me a break! After all this time, and he just expects to be my Dad all of the sudden!"
7680,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,I hear you.
7681,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"I mean, this could be a trap - the Kree purists, the Ravagers, now the Sovereign - they all want us dead."
7682,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"I know, but -"
7683,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,But what?
7684,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,What was that story you told me about Zardu Hasselfrau?
7685,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Who?
7686,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,The wonderful television-singer man. He had a magic boat.
7687,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,David Hasselhoff?
7688,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Right.
7689,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"He had a talking car, not a magic -"
7690,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Why did it talk again?
7691,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Just to be a good friend, I guess."
7692,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"And as a child you carried his picture in your pocket, and you told the other children he was your father, but he was out of town --"
7693,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany. Why are you bringing this up now? I was drunk when I told you that.
7694,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,I love that story.
7695,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"I don't. It's just sad! I was so sad because I'd see the other kids off playing catch with their dads, and I wanted that, more than anything in the world."
7696,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"My point is, maybe this man is your Hasselhoff. I know it's a long shot. But I lost my father as a child. I'd give anything..."
7697,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"If he ends up being evil, we'll just kill him."
7698,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,What's funny?
7699,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,He's not a fox.
7700,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Shoot her if she does anything suspicious. Or if you feel like it.
7701,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,It will just be a couple days. We'll be back before Rocket's finished fixing the ship.
7702,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,I have clones.
7703,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,There's no way for them to know they're here.
7704,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,You're like an old woman.
7705,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Hope daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy."
7706,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,So what's your goal here? To get everyone to hate you? `Cause it's working.
7707,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Can I ask you a personal question?
7708,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"The antennae, what are they for?"
7709,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,You're not supposed to say that.
7710,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Just making clear - if it's anything else - any other answer - I win?
7711,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Three pairs of pants.
7712,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,What are - ?
7713,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,You read minds?
7714,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Yeah, I guess, yeah, I have sort of a general, unselfish love for everyone."
7715,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"No. No, I don't."
7716,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,No.
7717,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"What the hell, dude? That's a total overreaction."
7718,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,You got to be kidding me.
7719,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,That's so incredibly uncool.
7720,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Touch me. And the only thing you're going to feel is a broken jaw.
7721,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Like what?
7722,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Is that real?
7723,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"It's kind of like someone put a baby's head on a big, muscular body, isn't it?"
7724,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Crap.
7725,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"How's it going, you blue idiot?"
7726,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"You give me your word you won't hurt Groot, and I'll tell you where the batteries are."
7727,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Hold on! There's got to be some sort of peaceful resolution here! Or even a violent resolution, where I'm standing over there."
7728,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Wow. You have your own planet?
7729,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,It's beautiful.
7730,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Single-handedly?
7731,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Whoa. It's perfect.
7732,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,You've got to be kidding.
7733,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,That's Ronan. That's you.
7734,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"You own a planet and can destroy two dozen spaceships without a suit. What are you, exactly?"
7735,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,A Celestial. Like a... god?
7736,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Wow.
7737,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Dude.
7738,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"I don't need to hear about how my parents, you know -"
7739,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,That's disgusting.
7740,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Oh my God.
7741,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,When did you meet my mother?
7742,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,If you loved her why did you leave her?
7743,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,I'm sorry. Your name is... it's `Taserface'?
7744,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Do you... shoot tasers out of your face?
7745,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,For what?
7746,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Really?... Okay, sure."
7747,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I just keep imagining you waking up one morning, looking in the mirror, and, in all seriousness, saying `You know what would be a really kickass name? Taserface!'"
7748,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,What was your second choice?! Scrotum Hat?!
7749,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Well, dying is certainly better than having to live an entire life as a moronic shitbag who thinks `Taserface' is a cool name."
7750,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,My mother told everyone my father was from the stars.
7751,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,She had brain cancer - so everyone thought she was delusional.
7752,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Listen. I'd love to believe all of this, I really would - but you left the most wonderful woman ever, to die alone!"
7753,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"So why didn't you come back?! Why'd you send Yondu, a criminal, of all people, to fetch me?!"
7754,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,I know exactly what that's like! I had to watch her die!
7755,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,What do you mean?
7756,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Whoa.
7757,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,What's going on?
7758,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,You're not ugly. Drax.
7759,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"Mantis, can you show us where we'll be staying? I'm getting eye-strain in this place."
7760,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Why are there no other beings on this planet?
7761,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,And you're not a flea?
7762,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?
7763,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Okay, Taserface. See you later, Taserface. Hey, Taserface, tell the other guys we said hi, Taserface!"
7764,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"No offense, but your employees are a bunch of jerks."
7765,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,That was mostly Drax.
7766,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Slow down, drama queen. You might deserve this, but I don't. We gotta get out of here."
7767,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Went off with his old man.
7768,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Yeah. It's a day for dumbass names.
7769,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"You smiled and for a second I got a warm feeling, but then it was ruined by those disgusting-ass teeth. Ever heard of floss?"
7770,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Pretty much a pro. Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego like you promised?
7771,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Oh, man. What'd they do to you?"
7772,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know what you were talking about. You have to explain it more careful."
7773,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot."
7774,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,But leave the eye here.
7775,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,He's gonna wake up tomorrow and he's not gonna know where his eye is!
7776,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,That's a desk. We told you it was this big.
7777,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Tell me you guys have a refrigerator somewhere with a bunch of severed human toes.
7778,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Okay, then let's just agree to never discuss this."
7779,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,He thinks you want him to wear it as a hat.
7780,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,He's relieved that you don't want him to.
7781,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,He hates hats.
7782,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"On anyone, not just himself."
7783,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"One minute you think someone has a weird-shaped head. The next minute, it's just because you realize part of that head is a hat. That's why you don't like hats?"
7784,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,No. Let's try again.
7785,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,One more thing.
7786,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,You got any clones of Quill's old music on the ship?
7787,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,You maniac. The whole ship is gonna blow.
7788,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Ego.
7789,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,I know that.
7790,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,So I guess this could all be mine someday.
7791,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"Rocket? Rocket, you there? Dammit."
7792,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"What are you doing, Peter?"
7793,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Dance with me.
7794,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,No. I'm not --
7795,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Come on. This is Sam Cooke, one of the greatest Earth singers of all time."
7796,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Drax thinks you're not a dancer.
7797,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"If you ever tell anyone about this, I'll kill you."
7798,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,When are we going to do something about this... unspoken thing between us?
7799,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,What unspoken thing?
7800,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,There is no unspoken thing between us.
7801,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Well, that's a Catch-22. Because if you said there was, it would be spoken, and then you'd be a liar. So by saying there isn't, you're telling the truth, and admitting there is."
7802,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,That's not --
7803,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,What we should be discussing right now is that something about this place doesn't feel right.
7804,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,What are you talking about? You were the one who wanted me to come here!
7805,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"That girl, Mantis. She's afraid of something."
7806,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Why are you trying to take this from me?
7807,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,I'm not --
7808,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,He's my father. He's blood -
7809,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,You have blood on earth. You never wanted to return there.
7810,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Again - you made me come here! And Earth?! Earth is the place my mother died in front of me.
7811,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"No, it's because that's real, and this is a fantasy."
7812,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"This is real. I'm only half human, remember?"
7813,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,That's the half I'm worried about.
7814,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Oh, I get it. You're jealous because I'm part god! You like me being the weak one!"
7815,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Uh. You were insufferable to begin with. I haven't been able to reach Rocket. I'm going to see if I can get a signal outside.
7816,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"You know, this isn't Cheers after all. It's whatever the show is where one person is willing to, you know, open themselves up to new possibilities, and the other person is just kind of a jerk who doesn't trust anyone! It's a show that doesn't exist - it would never be made, it would be so horrible! It would get zero ratings!"
7817,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,You're having a conversation with yourself! I don't know what Cheers is!
7818,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"I finally found my family, don't you understand that!?"
7819,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,I thought you already had.
7820,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"So this is how it ends, then? Our whole story. Like this? You and me?"
7821,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"Get it through your head, Peter. There is no you and me. There never was."
7822,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Dammit.
7823,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,You psychopath.
7824,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Are you kidding me?!
7825,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"Uh, no, I just spared your life -"
7826,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,You just let me live!
7827,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,I'm not the one who just flew across the universe because I wanted to win!
7828,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,I don't have to because you make it OBVI -
7829,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Yeah.
7830,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,You know - ?
7831,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Yes.
7832,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Yeah, it is."
7833,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Well, you might not be mortal, but ME -"
7834,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,I'm immortal? That's... really?
7835,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,And I can use the light to make cool things? Like how you made all this?
7836,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Well, get ready for an eight hundred foot statue of Pac Man, then. With Skeletor. And Heather Locklear. I'm gonna make some weird shit."
7837,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Wow, that..."
7838,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,How?
7839,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,What's that?
7840,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Doesn't eternity get boring?
7841,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,I see it. Eternity.
7842,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Oh my God.
7843,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,I could tell by how you talked about him - this Ego is bad news. We're here to save Quill.
7844,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,No! I don't care about those things! I want to save Quill so I can prove I'm better than him! I can lord this over him forever!
7845,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,What are you laughing at me for?!
7846,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"You don't know anything about me, loser."
7847,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Shut up.
7848,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"I said, shut up."
7849,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"I'm serious, dude - !"
7850,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,What kind of pair are we?
7851,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"All right, okay, that's - Wait. Fight a what?"
7852,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Who are you people?! What is this place?!
7853,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"The bodies in the caverns, who are they?!"
7854,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,It's beautiful.
7855,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,What did she do to me?!
7856,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,We need to find Peter now and get off this damn planet.
7857,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,No. He's our friend.
7858,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,My friends.
7859,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Yes. I don't need that.
7860,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Forever.
7861,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Temporary.
7862,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Yes.
7863,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,But my mother.
7864,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,You said you loved my mother.
7865,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Wh- what?
7866,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,You killed my mother!
7867,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Rocket?!
7868,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Keep that transmitter nearby so I can find you. We're in an old piece of construction equipment Yondu once used to slice open the Bank of A'askavaria.
7869,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Ego's unhinged -
7870,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,I know. Get ready.
7871,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,I got a plan.
7872,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,It's pretty simple.
7873,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,NO.
7874,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,I told you something didn't feel right.
7875,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,`I told you so.' That's really what I need right now.
7876,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"I came back, didn't I?"
7877,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Because there's an unspoken thing.
7878,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,There is no unspoken thing.
7879,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Uh, `Thank you, Rocket'?"
7880,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,What's Smurfette doing here!?
7881,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,She tried to murder me!
7882,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,He's not a fox.
7883,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,I'm not a raboon either!
7884,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"`Raccoon,' whatever!"
7885,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"There's the center to him - his brain, his soul, whatever it is, in some sort of shell --"
7886,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,YONDU?
7887,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,I guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid. Otherwise you would have delivered me to this maniac!
7888,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"That's what you told me, you old doofus!"
7889,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,You said you were gonna eat me!
7890,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Not to me!!
7891,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,You people have issues.
7892,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Of course I have issues that's my fricking father!!... Thrusters are back up.
7893,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,We can't. Ego wants to eradicate the universe as we know it. We have to kill him.
7894,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Rocket!
7895,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Got it.
7896,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"So, we're saving the galaxy again?"
7897,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,I guess.
7898,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Awesome. We'll really be able to jack up our prices if we're two- time-galaxy savers.
7899,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,I seriously can't believe that is where your mind goes.
7900,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"It was just a random thought, man! I thought we were friends!"
7901,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Of course I care about the planets, and the buildings, and all of the animals on the planets."
7902,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,And the people.
7903,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Meh.
7904,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,He needs my genetic connection to the light to help destroy the universe. He tried to teach me how to control the power.
7905,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,A little. I made a ball.
7906,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"I thought as hard as a could, that's all I could come up with."
7907,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,What do you use?
7908,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Whoa.
7909,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"That ore's thick. Rocket, we're gonna need to use the big laser."
7910,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Keep it still!
7911,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"We drill into the center, we kill him."
7912,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Why aren't you firing the laser?!
7913,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,They blew out the generator! I think I packed a small detonator.
7914,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,We got these!
7915,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Is it strong enough to kill Ego?
7916,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"If it is, it will cause a chain reaction throughout his entire nervous system."
7917,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Meaning what?
7918,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,The entire planet will explode. We'll have to get out of here fast. I rigged a timer.
7919,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Go!
7920,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"You need to, girl. If you don't keep Ego at bay, we all die."
7921,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,The metal is too thick! For the bomb to work we'd actually need to place it on Ego's core. And our fat butts ain't gonna fit through those tiny holes.
7922,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Well...
7923,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,That's a terrible idea.
7924,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Which is the only kind of idea we got left.
7925,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Unbelievable. `Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that.'"
7926,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Uh, what a day."
7927,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"All right. First you flick this switch, then this switch. That activates it. And then you push this button, which will give you five minutes to get out of there. Whatever you do don't push this button, because that will set off the bomb immediately, and we'll all be dead. Now repeat back what I just said."
7928,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Uh huh.
7929,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,That's right.
7930,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,No! That's the button that will kill everyone! Try again.
7931,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,No! That's exactly what you just said! How is that even possible?! Which button is the button you're supposed to push?! Point to it.
7932,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,NO!!!
7933,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Hey, you're making him nervous!"
7934,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Shut up! And give me some tape! Does anyone have any tape out there!? I want to put some tape over the death button!
7935,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,I don't have any tape. Let me check.
7936,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Yo, Yondu, do you have any - ow! - do you have any tape?!"
7937,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,No one has any tape.
7938,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Not a single person has tape?
7939,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,You have priceless batteries and an atomic bomb in your bag! If anyone had tape it would be you!
7940,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,That's exactly my point! I have to do everything!
7941,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Dude, you're wasting time!"
7942,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,We're all gonna die.
7943,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,We're gonna blow!
7944,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Peter?
7945,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,You look like Mary Poppins.
7946,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Yeah. He's cool.
7947,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Oh. Wow.
7948,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,How long before the bomb goes off?
7949,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"In the unlikely event Groot doesn't kill us all, about six minutes."
7950,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Someone needs to be up top when Kraglin arrives. Drax, take Mantis."
7951,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Gamora!!
7952,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,We have to get up to the extraction point!
7953,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,You shouldn't have killed my mom and squished my walkman.
7954,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"Groot! Groot, if you can can hear me, hurry up - I'm not sure how long Quill can keep him distracted!"
7955,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Yondu! We're about to blow!
7956,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Not without Quill.
7957,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Not without you.
7958,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,A space suit and an aero rig. I only have one of each.
7959,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,He says welcome to the frickin' Guardians of the Galaxy... only he didn't use `frickin'.
7960,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,We're gonna need to have a discussion about your language.
7961,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Where's Peter?
7962,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"Rocket, where is he?!"
7963,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"Rocket?! Rocket, look at me! Where is he?!"
7964,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,I'm not leaving without him.
7965,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,"I'm sorry. I can only afford to lose one friend today. Kraglin, GO!"
7966,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,What's so wrong with that?
7967,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,What?
7968,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,What?
7969,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Yondu, you can't! What are you doing? What are you doing?!"
7970,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Yondu. Yondu, no!"
7971,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,No.
7972,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,No!
7973,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,The other day I told Gamora how I used to pretend my dad was David Hasselhoff.
7974,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,He's a singer and actor from earth... a really famous guy.
7975,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"And, you know, today it struck me. Yondu didn't have a talking car, but he did have a flying arrow. And he didn't have the voice of an angel, but he did have the whistle of one. And both David Hasselhoff and Yondu went on kickass adventures, and hooked up with hot women, and fought robots."
7976,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"So, the thing is, David Hasselhoff kinda did end up being my Dad after all, only he was Yondu. I had a pretty cool Dad."
7977,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"And what I'm trying to say here is, that thing you're searching for your whole life, sometimes it's right there by your side all along and you don't even know it."
7978,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Yeah. That's the friend I was talking about.
7979,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,He did call you `twig.'
7980,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,Nebula.
7981,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,I was just a child. Like you. I was concerned with staying alive until the next day - every day. And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you. I am sorry.
7982,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"I'm trying to make it right, everything I did."
7983,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,"There are little girls like you were - little boys - all over the universe - who are in danger. You can stay with us, and help them."
7984,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,I don't know if that's possible.
7985,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,You'll always be my sister.
7986,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Wait.
7987,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Rocket grabbed the pieces and reassembled them. I think Yondu would want you to have it.
7988,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,They came.
7989,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager buddies and told them what he did.
7990,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,It's a Ravager funeral.
7991,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,He didn't chase `em away.
7992,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,No.
7993,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,Even though he yelled at `em.
7994,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,And was always mean.
7995,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,ROCKET,And he stole batteries he didn't need.
7996,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Of course not.
7997,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,What?
7998,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,GAMORA,It's just some unspoken thing.
7999,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Dude, seriously, you got to clean up your room. It's a complete mess."
8000,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"I'm not boring, man. You're boring. Once I got stuck on a planet where everyone was just lines and dots. I had to use geometry to get out of prison. Is that boring?"
8001,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,You know what's boring? Not doing the dishes. What's boring is me tripping over your vines everywhere.
8002,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Drax and I switched pants in the middle of that party last weekend. For no reason other than we're awesome and very much not boring.
8003,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"Once I got a venereal disease that made me float for three days... Don't tell Gamora... it's dormant, but... If that's boring then, I guess I'm boring."
8004,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,I'm not boring.
8005,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,"What's boring is when you roll your eyes like that at me and make an exasperated sound like I'm an old, boring, stupid idiot."
8006,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Now I know how Yondu felt.
8007,Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-2,QUILL,Yondu.
8008,Hangover-The,PHIL,"He's in his late 20's, tall, rugged -- and currently a mess. His shirt is ripped open, his aviator sunglasses are bent, his lip is bloodied, and he clearly hasn't slept in days."
8009,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Tracy, it's Vick. Parked on the dirt road behind Vick is his near-totalled 1967 Cadillac Deville convertible; it's scratched, dented, filthy - - and missing its passenger side door. Slouched inside are TWO OTHER GUYS, also looking like hell."
8010,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Listen, honey...The bachelor party got a little out of control and, well...we lost Doug."
8011,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Yeah, that's not gonna happen."
8012,Hangover-The,STU,Dude this is already the best weekend ever!
8013,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Stu, relax, we're still on the 10."
8014,Hangover-The,STU,"Oh, did I show you pictures of my kids?!"
8015,Hangover-The,STU,"Haylee is two, and Kaitlin is already four! Can you believe it?!"
8016,Hangover-The,PHIL,"The one on the left is gonna be a hottie. The other one, not so much. Stu protectively snatches the photos back, muttering:"
8017,Hangover-The,STU,"Jesus, dude, those are my children--"
8018,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Hey, am I rubbed in? Stu glances over and sees un-rubbed-in sunscreen all over Alan's face."
8019,Hangover-The,STU,"Yeah, you're good."
8020,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Of course they are, Doug. Jesus, Alan's been dating Becky for 14 years. When they first met, Alan had braces and soccer hair, and Becky had a functioning hymen."
8021,Hangover-The,PHIL,Asking Alan if he's still with Becky is like asking the sun if it still rises in the east. The guys try not to laugh; Alan scowls.
8022,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Enh, we've moved past the pressure stage...it's more like aggravated assault stage now? Like at the last wedding we went to, she threw a camera at my head, called me a closet fag, then ran out crying. The guys wince, oooo."
8023,Hangover-The,ALAN,"But we talked, and everything's cool now."
8024,Hangover-The,STU,Maybe you could wear a helmet to Doug's wedding.
8025,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Great idea, Stu. Thanks."
8026,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Oh, great. Yeah, I'm working on bringing the next big dessert craze to Los Angeles. It's gonna be huge."
8027,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Bavarian custard. We ran the numbers, and it's gonna be bigger than fro yo. Doug and Stu nod, impressed; only Alan looks skeptical."
8028,Hangover-The,ALAN,Isn't custard like a trillion calories--?
8029,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Our plan is to open three stores in the Valley and then franchise it. Shares are selling fast, but I can probably squeeze you guys in..."
8030,Hangover-The,STU,"Me too, man! I love pudding! Alan just shakes his head, unbelievable."
8031,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Is this gonna do better than the hip-hop label you started, Vick? Or the topless sushi bar? Or the mobile tattoo parlor--?"
8032,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Tattoo-To-You was an idea ahead of it's time, Alan! And don't come crying to me when there's a Custard Cabana on every street corner in America and you didn't buy in--!"
8033,Hangover-The,STU,"Dude! I can't believe I get to party all night, and then, tomorrow ...I get to sleep in! It's almost too much! And FYI, if anyone gets really drunk and craps themself, just let me know, I can have you cleaned up and partying again in under three minutes. No joke. I am a master of stool removal... They rocket off into the desert, LAUGHING..."
8034,Hangover-The,PHIL,Checking in. Lennon comma Victor. The man types into his computer.
8035,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Hold it right there, Atashir. This is my best friend from childhood, Douglas Billings. In two days, he is to marry a woman of great beauty and strong teeth, do you understand? A woman of gigantic bosoms who will give him many, many sons... Atashir looks confused. Alan looks embarrassed."
8036,Hangover-The,PHIL,"My two other childhood friends have travelled great distances, across many deserts, to be here. This isn't a night in a hotel for us, Atashir: this is a family reunion. Perhaps you too have family situated great distances away, in a foreign country with much sand? Atashir looks like, sort of...? Vick reaches over the counter and touches his arm, simpatico."
8037,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Then I have but one question for you, friend: if they came to town, would you put them in an economy suite?"
8038,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Well, then. I think one of us needs to get back on his little computer and find us a suitable room. Atashir frowns...but types away at his computer."
8039,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Dean-o will be fine. Send up a case of Cristal, two bottles of Patron, four ahi sandwiches, and a crate of skinless mangos... Vick turns to the guys:"
8040,Hangover-The,PHIL,"You guys want anything? The guys stammer, too stunned to speak."
8041,Hangover-The,PHIL,And have Jean-Marie cook up a dozen of those duck skewers I like so well. He knows the ones.
8042,Hangover-The,PHIL,"American Express. Atashir looks up to accept the card. After a beat, Vick turns to Alan:"
8043,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Dude, give him your AmEx."
8044,Hangover-The,ALAN,What?
8045,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Don't worry, we'll hit you later. Alan stammers."
8046,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Dude, come on, I paid for gas. Stop being such a Jew. Alan stammers some more -- then angrily pulls out his card."
8047,Hangover-The,STU,"This is bigger than my house. Vick blows past them, totally unfazed."
8048,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Get dressed, ladies. We're wheels up in ten. Stu and Doug race off to find their bedrooms, leaving Alan standing alone, just staring at the decadent suite."
8049,Hangover-The,ALAN,I am so not getting paid back.
8050,Hangover-The,PHIL,This is Vick.
8051,Hangover-The,PHIL,He's in Vegas?! You're kidding me!
8052,Hangover-The,PHIL,"I said all right, dude! How many more times you want me to say all right?!"
8053,Hangover-The,ALAN,"So, you ready for Sunday?"
8054,Hangover-The,ALAN,Tracy's dad still hate you?
8055,Hangover-The,ALAN,Any closer to figuring out why?
8056,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Ahhh yeah, I wasn't going to tell anyone about that-- Just then, Stu wanders in, wearing only his COLORADO STATE BOXER SHORTS. His gut is sizable."
8057,Hangover-The,STU,Anyone got any nipple lube--? Jesus would you look at the size of that thing?! Stu grabs the ring from Doug.
8058,Hangover-The,STU,"Jesus, who made this thing? Diddy?"
8059,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Actually, I-I was trying to keep it a secret, so-- Just then Vick blows in, singing, effeminate:"
8060,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Boy Party in the bathrooooom--! Miner's cut, 2.6 Carats, slight pink tint, street value: 26, 27K. Vick studies it in the light. Alan just rubs his temples."
8061,Hangover-The,STU,"Dude, it's for Becky! Alan's finally going to propose!"
8062,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Well gosh-golly, Alan Mervish, good for you! Where'd you get the ring?"
8063,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Oh, it's a family heirloom. My grandmother smuggled it through the Holocaust, actually. I was going to propose to Beck this weekend. Doug throws his arm around Alan, happy for him."
8064,Hangover-The,STU,Thish is so great! I love you guys!
8065,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Check it out, Stu's already wasted. Vick starts refilling everyone's glasses."
8066,Hangover-The,ALAN,"We've only had two shots, man!"
8067,Hangover-The,STU,"Dude, I'm a dad! I don't have time to get plastered anymore! It blows!"
8068,Hangover-The,STU,Because my dad was a bad dad.
8069,Hangover-The,STU,Have I showed you guys pictures of my kids yet--?
8070,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Jesus, what do you take us for?"
8071,Hangover-The,STU,Oh yeah! That was hilarious! And remember when I blacked out at Homecoming and you wrote on my face with permanent marker?! That was awesome! What'd you write again?
8072,Hangover-The,STU,"Ahh, good times, man. Good times..."
8073,Hangover-The,PHIL,"We'll be good tonight, Doug."
8074,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Seriously, man, we're your friends."
8075,Hangover-The,STU,"Yeah, we've totally grown up since then. Doug looks at them, highly dubious, then hoists his glass."
8076,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Damn, dude, why are you retarded? Both men are ragingly hungover. A long beat as both of them rub their faces, then:"
8077,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Um, Stuey?"
8078,Hangover-The,STU,Yo.
8079,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Why do you have a mullet? Stu does, in fact, have a mullet haircut. But he's too hungover to understand."
8080,Hangover-The,STU,What?
8081,Hangover-The,PHIL,"You know, business on top, party down the back? Stu still looks confused. This is excruciating for Vick."
8082,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Your hair, dude. You have a mullet. Stu touches his hair. Then he stumbles into the bathroom. After a beat, we hear his voice:"
8083,Hangover-The,STU,"Dude...I have a mullet. Then we hear ALAN'S VOICE in the bathroom, groggy:"
8084,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Just give me ten more minutes, Beck..."
8085,Hangover-The,STU,"Whoa, did you sleep in the tub? Beat, then Stu pokes his head out of the bathroom."
8086,Hangover-The,STU,Check it out: Alan slept in the tub.
8087,Hangover-The,PHIL,Get him up. I'm hungry. Stu disappears back into the bathroom. We hear the SHOWER turn on. Beat. Then we hear Alan slowly awaken:
8088,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Wet. Water. Jesus, what's--?! There's a THUD as Alan falls out of tub. Beat. Then Stu and a very confused, very hungover, very wet Alan stumble out of the bathroom. Alan appears to be wearing his polo shirt from the night before. Only, as we PULL BACK, we see that his shirt is cut off at his chest -- he's naked from there down."
8089,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Jesus, dude, put away your sack. Alan looks down at his hairy nakedness, totally bewildered."
8090,Hangover-The,STU,"Yeah, and it might be time for some manscaping, bro. Your bush looks like Yanni. Alan looks back up again, squinting, hungover."
8091,Hangover-The,ALAN,What did we do last night?
8092,Hangover-The,STU,"Dude, why is my ass killing me...?"
8093,Hangover-The,PHIL,"We might not smell very good. The guys shake their heads, yeah, no."
8094,Hangover-The,STU,"This might be the worst hangover anyone has ever had, ever."
8095,Hangover-The,ALAN,I can't taste anything.
8096,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Please stop talking. If I don't focus on eating I'm going to throw up all over myself. The guys nod, right. They keep eating. After a long while:"
8097,Hangover-The,ALAN,Hey... Are we missing something? The guys all slowly look around. Then Stu points at Alan:
8098,Hangover-The,STU,"Yes: I left my hat in the room -- thank you, Alan. They continue eating. Alan looks up again, still troubled."
8099,Hangover-The,ALAN,No. That's not it... There's something else... Vick nods at Stu as he stuffs food in his mouth.
8100,Hangover-The,PHIL,"You gonna finish that cruller? Stu shakes his head, no. Vick takes it, packs it into his already stuffed mouth. Then Alan realizes:"
8101,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Doug. Guys, where's Doug? The guys look around. Hunh."
8102,Hangover-The,STU,Yeah. He's not here.
8103,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Probably left him in the room. Vick pulls out his cell phone, starts dialing."
8104,Hangover-The,PHIL,I'll call his cell. Then a phone RINGS in Stu's pocket. He answers:
8105,Hangover-The,STU,"Good morning, this is Stu?"
8106,Hangover-The,PHIL,"It's me, meatdick."
8107,Hangover-The,STU,It's Vick-- Then Stu realizes. Oh.
8108,Hangover-The,STU,"This is Doug's phone. Vick nods, ya. He's already dialing another number."
8109,Hangover-The,ALAN,"You calling the room? Vick nods, uh-huh. He lets it ring, rubbing his temples. Then he hangs up."
8110,Hangover-The,PHIL,No answer. Vick goes back to eating. Alan frowns.
8111,Hangover-The,ALAN,Ummm...shouldn't we look for him? Check-out is in like ten minutes.
8112,Hangover-The,STU,"Yeah, and we told Tracy we'd have Doug back to LA by five. Vick just looks at both of them, his mouth full of food:"
8113,Hangover-The,PHIL,I'm eabing.
8114,Hangover-The,ALAN,"What an asshole. Stu, check the pool and the casino, I'll check the room and the gym. Maybe he's working out or something... Stu nods, and they slowly slide out of the booth."
8115,Hangover-The,ALAN,"And Vick, if you could keep a close eye on the buffet, that'd be really helpful. Thanks, man. Alan and Stu saunter off. Vick yells after them, mouth full:"
8116,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Doug...? Doug...? Wake up, man. Alan enters the bedroom where Doug slept, and stops. It takes him a second to realize what's wrong:"
8117,Hangover-The,ALAN,That's weird...
8118,Hangover-The,STU,"No, no. It's cool, I'm a dad. It's totally cool..."
8119,Hangover-The,ALAN,I hate you all...
8120,Hangover-The,STU,"Hey guys. DOUG! DOUG--! Then Stu registers what just happened. He stops and turns around -- enh? -- but the gay men are gone. Before he can comment, however, he sees Vick and Alan talking to Atashir at"
8121,Hangover-The,STU,You find Doug?
8122,Hangover-The,ALAN,"No, I assume you didn't either? Stu shakes his head, no. Then Atashir hangs up his phone."
8123,Hangover-The,STU,Maybe he went for a jog?
8124,Hangover-The,ALAN,Dude. It's 120 degrees outside.
8125,Hangover-The,STU,Or shopping? The guys just look at him like: you're an idiot.
8126,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Great. So we've officially lost Doug. His wedding is in what, 22 hours?"
8127,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Relax, it's Doug, he's probably crashed out on someone's couch right now. All we have to do is retrace our steps from last night, and we'll find him."
8128,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Okay, so last night... The guys wince, trying to remember. It's painful to think."
8129,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Well, we started on the roof..."
8130,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Right, that was like, 6ish...?"
8131,Hangover-The,PHIL,Then...I think...we had steaks at the Palm?
8132,Hangover-The,ALAN,Yeah. Then...we played craps at the Hard Rock...maybe?
8133,Hangover-The,PHIL,"That sounds right... Stu throws up his arms, already giving up."
8134,Hangover-The,STU,"Okay, honestly? I don't even remember going to dinner."
8135,Hangover-The,PHIL,I vaguely recall...doing body shots ....at some point? Is that...maybe?
8136,Hangover-The,ALAN,I'm pretty much blank after The Hard Rock.
8137,Hangover-The,PHIL,"I think we went to the Flamingo after that...? And then, I just remember a lot of blue light...and the overpowering smell of baby oil."
8138,Hangover-The,ALAN,"So that was what, 10ish?"
8139,Hangover-The,PHIL,Give or take.
8140,Hangover-The,STU,"Was Doug still with us? Vick rubs his temples, trying to fight through the hangover."
8141,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Yes. Yes. Doug was with us. I tackled him...for some reason. The guys nod, okay, okay."
8142,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Okay. So we only have a 13 hour window where we could've lost him. They guys frown. Shit. Stu puts his hands into his pockets, thinking... Then he feels something. A matchbook. He pulls it out. It's from The Flamingo Nightclub."
8143,Hangover-The,STU,"Hey! Look, we were at the Flamingo. A long beat of silence... Then the guys hurry to an empty BLACKJACK TABLE and start emptying their pockets of the detritus from the night before. They find matchbooks, receipts, room keys, a valet ticket..."
8144,Hangover-The,ALAN,ATM receipt from the Rio at 10:37-- For 600 dollars?!
8145,Hangover-The,PHIL,The valet ticket says we returned here at 4:57AM.
8146,Hangover-The,STU,"We drove last night? The guys wince, jesus..."
8147,Hangover-The,ALAN,Here's a receipt from Sbarro. The meal was comped for some reason--
8148,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Why do we have a matchbook from The Golden Pony All Male Revue? The guys exchange a look, alarmed."
8149,Hangover-The,ALAN,Someone could've given that to us.
8150,Hangover-The,STU,"Yeah, totally! There's no way we went there! We're not gay! Hahaha! They frown, then stare at all the clues lined up on the blackjack table."
8151,Hangover-The,ALAN,I think we should call Tracy.
8152,Hangover-The,PHIL,Absolutely not.
8153,Hangover-The,ALAN,"What if Doug called her? She might know where he is. Stu shifts uncomfortably, tenderly adjusting his ass."
8154,Hangover-The,STU,"Yeah, I'm with Alan on this one."
8155,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Of course you're with Alan, you're both gutless cowards. But we're not calling Tracy. You never call the bride from the bachelor party. Ever. If my balls were on fire and Tracy was sitting next door with a tall glass of water, I still wouldn't call her. It's a rule."
8156,Hangover-The,ALAN,But shouldn't we at least tell her we're gonna be getting home late?
8157,Hangover-The,PHIL,"She has a watch, she'll figure it out."
8158,Hangover-The,ALAN,I think I'm beginning to see why you're always single.
8159,Hangover-The,PHIL,And I think I'm beginning to see why you're always a douche--
8160,Hangover-The,STU,"Guys, wait. I need your help -- oh my God -- like right now. Come on."
8161,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Jesus, what is it?"
8162,Hangover-The,PHIL,I can't believe we're doing this.
8163,Hangover-The,STU,"You don't have to look up my butt, just at it. Something is terribly, terribly wrong... Stu's jeans fall to the ground -- and everyone freezes."
8164,Hangover-The,ALAN,Sweet mother of mercy...
8165,Hangover-The,PHIL,Who's Roger?
8166,Hangover-The,STU,I-I-I don't know?! What do you think it means?!
8167,Hangover-The,PHIL,"What do I think it means? Well, Stuart, your ass is all torn up and you're wearing thong underwear declaring your love for another dude -- I don't think we need the CSI team for this one! You got reamed last night, man! Stu covers his mouth, horrified!"
8168,Hangover-The,ALAN,I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for this...
8169,Hangover-The,STU,Really?! What?! Alan tries to think of one.
8170,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Yeah, maybe there isn't."
8171,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Look, I'm sure Roger is a very nice, considerate young man--"
8172,Hangover-The,STU,"Oh my God, guys: what if I'm gay?!"
8173,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Come on, Stu, you're nowhere near cool enough."
8174,Hangover-The,STU,I do watch Dancing With The Stars with the kids!
8175,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Oh god, that doesn't mean you're gay."
8176,Hangover-The,PHIL,But sort of...it does? Stu grows increasingly frantic.
8177,Hangover-The,STU,"And once, I caught myself gazing at a topless photo of David Beckham!"
8178,Hangover-The,ALAN,"So what, he's a great-looking dude--"
8179,Hangover-The,STU,"And then I had those weird feelings for Vick that time in middle school, remember?! Everyone stops. Vick most of all."
8180,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Um, what?"
8181,Hangover-The,STU,"Yeah, that weekend we were all camping -- I told you this."
8182,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Yeah, no you didn't."
8183,Hangover-The,STU,I didn't?
8184,Hangover-The,PHIL,"I think I'd remember, dude."
8185,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Yeah, I think we'd all remember."
8186,Hangover-The,STU,"Yeah. I had weird feelings for you that weekend. Like really hot, really gay feelings. But then they went away. Vick is just looking at him, stunned."
8187,Hangover-The,ALAN,Wait -- I was there that weekend. Did you have gay feelings for me?
8188,Hangover-The,PHIL,Unbelievable.
8189,Hangover-The,ALAN,What?! I was a good-looking kid!
8190,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Please, you're so not his type!"
8191,Hangover-The,STU,"Wait, what? Just then, a FATHER and his YOUNG SON enter the men's room and see Stu standing there, pants down, in his G string..."
8192,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Look, Stu, one homosexual experience doesn't mean you're permanently gay, okay? A lot of guys test the waters. ...the FATHER and SON wheel right back around and exit."
8193,Hangover-The,ALAN,"All right, we're scaring the children. Let's go. The guys head for the door. Stu quickly pulls up his pants."
8194,Hangover-The,STU,Wait -- so have either of you tested the waters?
8195,Hangover-The,PHIL,No! We're not gay!
8196,Hangover-The,STU,How am I going to tell my wife?
8197,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Quickly, and from a great distance. Alan's hand accidentally hits a brass railing and CLINKS..."
8198,Hangover-The,STU,"Jesus, what kind of father am I? Alan's hand CLINKS against the railing again, and this time it registers. Alan looks down -- and stops cold."
8199,Hangover-The,ALAN,Oh my God.
8200,Hangover-The,STU,You think Erin will try to take the kids--?
8201,Hangover-The,ALAN,Oh...my...God.
8202,Hangover-The,PHIL,"What now? Alan holds up the source of his CLINKING: on his ring finger is a huge, tacky, silver WEDDING RING with a unicorn on it."
8203,Hangover-The,STU,"Cool ring. Also, my Dad is gonna have a field day with this. Vick, however, recognizes the implications of the ring, and starts back towards Alan."
8204,Hangover-The,PHIL,Oh my God... Oh my God...
8205,Hangover-The,STU,What's the big--? Oh! OH! OH!
8206,Hangover-The,STU,Maybe it's not a wedding ring?
8207,Hangover-The,ALAN,"""To My Noble Husband, Alan."" The guys eyes bulge, oh shit!"
8208,Hangover-The,STU,This is worse than my underwear! Vick takes the ring and reads the rest of the inscription:
8209,Hangover-The,PHIL,"""Now & Forever Wedding Chapel."" They guys exchange a look."
8210,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Well, at least it's a lead. Beat. Then Alan turns and THROWS UP all over the slot machine. Nearby OCTOGENARIAN SLOT PLAYERS look over, disgusted -- but continue playing their nickels."
8211,Hangover-The,PHIL,"So, we go to the wedding chapel, we find out what we did with Doug, we recover him, and we're back in LA before sundown. Easy as Stu's ass. No one laughs. Tense SILENCE as they wait for the car."
8212,Hangover-The,STU,"Check it out, some idiot threw his bed out the window last night. Stu points over at a huge stone GRIFFIN in front of the hotel with an ENTIRE BED impaled upon its ear."
8213,Hangover-The,ALAN,"That was us, dude."
8214,Hangover-The,STU,Really?
8215,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Yeah, there's no bed in Doug's room."
8216,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Yeah, Stu, I really do."
8217,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Guys, relax. Everything's gonna be cool... Just then the Valet drives up in"
8218,Hangover-The,STU,"You okay, Vick?"
8219,Hangover-The,PHIL,"I'm not emotionally prepared to talk about it just yet, Stuart, but thank you. Vick dons his sunglasses and heads for his destroyed car..."
8220,Hangover-The,ALAN,Seriously: what am I gonna tell Becky? For 14 years she's been begging me to get married...
8221,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Well, now you did. Just not to her. Alan glowers at the city going by... Then he sits up--"
8222,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Wait, is that homeless guy wearing Doug's shirt? The guys turn to see a HOMELESS GUY weaving down the sidewalk in Doug's DISTINCTIVE ORANGE SHIRT from the night before. Once they pass, the guys exchange a look."
8223,Hangover-The,STU,Naaah.
8224,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Yeah, that was a different shirt. Alan doesn't look so sure. They drive in silence. Then:"
8225,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Left turn. Stu, sitting shotgun, braces against the empty doorframe so as not to fall out of the car as they turn left..."
8226,Hangover-The,ALAN,What if they don't remember us--?
8227,Hangover-The,CAPTAIN AMERICA,"How are you, you dumb bastards?!"
8228,Hangover-The,PHIL,Does the pope wear a funny hat?! Let's do this thing! Steve CACKLES and guides them over to a table; Alan scowls.
8229,Hangover-The,CAPTAIN AMERICA,And where is Chastity today? They all sit on white plastic chairs.
8230,Hangover-The,ALAN,W-Who's...Chastity?
8231,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Uh, it was such a lovely ceremony, wasn't it?"
8232,Hangover-The,CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Hand to God, I've never seen two people more in love!"
8233,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Sadly, I believe you... The guys look at the photos of Alan's wedding from the night before. They're typical wedding shots, only the guys are all wearing MEDIEVAL COSTUMES, swords, bows, tights, even armor. They look incredibly happy -- and incredibly drunk. The next photo is of Alan and his BUSTY BLONDE BRIDE. She's having a blast in a white medieval gown and tiara."
8234,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Hello, Chastity... Alan just closes his eyes, oh God."
8235,Hangover-The,ALAN,I am never...ever...drinking again.
8236,Hangover-The,STU,"Jesus, she is stacked."
8237,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Stu, please, show some class. That's Alan's wife you're talking about."
8238,Hangover-The,STU,"Sorry. She looks really nice. But Alan is too busy gaping at the next photo, of him and Chastity atop a UNICORN in the chapel."
8239,Hangover-The,ALAN,We got a unicorn?!
8240,Hangover-The,CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Oh, yeah, you got the entire Double Camelot Package. Alan just rubs his temples, oh no."
8241,Hangover-The,ALAN,A-And how much did that cost?
8242,Hangover-The,CAPTAIN AMERICA,"7 thousand dollars. Alan closes his eyes. Stu and Vick exchange a look, no way!"
8243,Hangover-The,CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Yeah, you didn't want to get it, either, but Vick insisted. Beat. Then Alan pounces across the table at Vick!"
8244,Hangover-The,ALAN,I'm gonna kill you!
8245,Hangover-The,PHIL,"You can't put a pricetag on love, Alan! OW! You just can't!"
8246,Hangover-The,PHIL,"It's good to be seen, Carla. It's good to be seen."
8247,Hangover-The,STU,No way! Awesome!
8248,Hangover-The,CAPTAIN AMERICA,A hundred DVDs of the ceremony... She lays out the stacks of DVDs. Vick nods at Alan:
8249,Hangover-The,PHIL,"For you and Chastity to watch on your anniversary... Alan just clenches his jaw, I fucking hate you."
8250,Hangover-The,PHIL,"And it looks like real velvet, Alan, so no machine wash, okay?"
8251,Hangover-The,STU,I want a shield!
8252,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Me too! Hey, can Stu and I get a shield?"
8253,Hangover-The,ALAN,"I don't suppose you have any sort of return policy, do you?"
8254,Hangover-The,CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Um...if you know another couple who looks exactly like you guys, and who want two dozen commuter mugs, a wall hanging, and a shield...sure. Alan scowls. Then his cellphone RINGS. He angrily answers it without looking at the Caller ID."
8255,Hangover-The,ALAN,What. We hear someone YELLING AT HIM. Alan's eyes bulge.
8256,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Oh, hey Becky! Hi! He steps away to take the call. Vick explains to Carla:"
8257,Hangover-The,PHIL,That's his girlfriend of 14 years. I'm sure this'll only take a minute...
8258,Hangover-The,ALAN,"No! I-I have no idea--! Then Vick calls over from the white plastic table, pissed:"
8259,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Nothing! Baby, nothing, the GUYS"
8260,Hangover-The,ALAN,"I know, baby! I know--"
8261,Hangover-The,ALAN,Yes. I will. I promise.
8262,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Yes, no, I love you too! Becky hangs up, rolling her eyes, unbelievable. STAY WITH ALAN as he closes his cellphone. Exhales."
8263,Hangover-The,STU,"Hey, how's Becky doing, man?!"
8264,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Yeah, did she ask about us?! Off of Alan's hate-filled glare, we"
8265,Hangover-The,STU,"Look on the bright side, Alan. Vick found a great clue."
8266,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Turns out Doug was in all the wedding photos, which means -- if the time stamp was right -- we had him in our possession until 11 pm."
8267,Hangover-The,STU,That's another hour of last night that we can account for. Isn't that great?
8268,Hangover-The,ALAN,Amazing.
8269,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Hey, Steve, you don't happen to know where we were heading when we left here last night, do you?"
8270,Hangover-The,CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Well, the Double Camelot Package comes with a five course wedding feast, so I assume you went there."
8271,Hangover-The,STU,Great -- where was the feast?
8272,Hangover-The,CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Sbarro, over in the Fremont mall."
8273,Hangover-The,ALAN,I paid 7 grand for Sbarro?!
8274,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Your negativity is like a little black cloud over our car, Alan. You've got to let go of this."
8275,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Let go of what, exactly, Vick?! The fact that I married a complete stranger last night? Or that my girlfriend's about to leave me? Or that I'm broke? Which one?!"
8276,Hangover-The,PHIL,You're broke? I thought you were
8277,Hangover-The,ALAN,"I know you think it's like terminally uncool to be in a committed relationship, Vick, but I actually love Becky, okay?"
8278,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Alan. Honey. Have you considered, even for a second, that maybe the things we do when we're drunk are what we secretly want to do?"
8279,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Yeah, no, you're absolutely right, Vick, I've always secretly wanted to marry a bottle blonde with big fake melon tits named Chastity!"
8280,Hangover-The,STU,"I ain't mad atcha, dude..."
8281,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Or, after 14 years, maybe you don't have the balls to leave Becky, and this is your way of getting her to leave you."
8282,Hangover-The,ALAN,"I was going to propose to her this weekend, you jackass!"
8283,Hangover-The,PHIL,"All the more reason to freak out. Alan opens his mouth to respond, but nothing comes out. Vick nods, chew on that, and continues slowly reversing the car."
8284,Hangover-The,PHIL,"I love you, Alan Mervish, I do, but you've always had a major pole up your ass. Maybe last night was your inner cool person trying to get out-"
8285,Hangover-The,ALAN,"I swear to God, Vick, if you say one more word to me, I will destroy you."
8286,Hangover-The,STU,"Guys, come on, let's not use our angry words--"
8287,Hangover-The,PHIL,"What the--?! They look up to see two MASSIVE SAMOAN MEN in loud Hawaiian shirts, KALOLO FANALUA and KIKIOLANI, 30's, standing on either side of the car. And they look pissed."
8288,Hangover-The,STU,Who are these guys?!
8289,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Stu, please. I think there's been some sort of mistake, Mister...?"
8290,Hangover-The,PHIL,Those so aren't their real names.
8291,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Vick, don't be a dick--!"
8292,Hangover-The,PHIL,Alan? Relax. These men aren't going to hurt us. They're from Hawaii.
8293,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Okay, okay! Cool it with the bat! Jesus, why is everyone trying to kill my car...? Vick undoes his seatbelt and reaches for his door handle. Kikiolani lowers his bat -- and Vick throws the door open, right into his nuts! The huge Samoan staggers back, OWWW, and Vick slams his door shut and"
8294,Hangover-The,ALAN,Why'd you do that?!
8295,Hangover-The,STU,Maybe they just wanted to talk!
8296,Hangover-The,PHIL,I honestly don't know how you two are still alive.
8297,Hangover-The,ALAN,Do you think we stole something from them last night?!
8298,Hangover-The,STU,Oh my god I am such a bad dad!
8299,Hangover-The,ALAN,I'm calling the police. This is getting way out of control--
8300,Hangover-The,PHIL,No! No cops!
8301,Hangover-The,ALAN,"""No cops?!"" Who are you, Fitty Cent?!"
8302,Hangover-The,STU,"Yeah, Vick, what's going on?"
8303,Hangover-The,PHIL,Nothing! I just think we should focus on finding Doug and not get distracted by every little thing!
8304,Hangover-The,ALAN,Every little thing?! We were just assaulted by the Yakuza!
8305,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Oh please, those guys are from Guam. Get a grip."
8306,Hangover-The,ALAN,"They knew your name, Vick! Which means they probably know who Stu and I are, too!"
8307,Hangover-The,STU,"If anything ever happened to my family, Vick..."
8308,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Fine. Let's just go back to the hotel -- Doug is probably back from wherever he spent the night, we'll get him, we'll straighten out whatever we did to those angry Samoans, then we'll get the hell back to LA, okay? Left turn. Vick angrily takes a harder-than-necessary left turn. Alan hangs on tight, almost flying out of the car."
8309,Hangover-The,PHIL,Doug? Doug? Alan quickly checks the room phone.
8310,Hangover-The,ALAN,No messages.
8311,Hangover-The,STU,"Come on, let's toss the place. Alan starts wading through the crap in the living room, while Vick and Stu head off to check the bedrooms..."
8312,Hangover-The,STU,"Hey, check it out, Vick! I invested 30 grand in your custard store last night! Vick calls from the other bedroom."
8313,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Smart move, man. Stu opens the closet door -- and freezes."
8314,Hangover-The,STU,"Hey, you wanna come in here a sec?! Vick enters a moment later to find Stu staring into the closet. Vick follows his gaze and sees a SEXY WOMAN snoring away on the closet floor, her blonde hair obscuring her face."
8315,Hangover-The,PHIL,Whoa.
8316,Hangover-The,STU,You think she's what those Guamian dudes wanted?
8317,Hangover-The,PHIL,"No. I think she's Alan's wife. Stu covers his mouth, oh shit! Vick produces the wallet- sized photos from Alan's wedding, compares them, and nods."
8318,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Alan? Wanna step in here, buddy? A second later Alan enters, what's up?"
8319,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Alan, Chastity. Chastity, Alan. Alan looks down, sees Chastity SNORING on the closet floor, her body all contorted, and freezes. Oh my God."
8320,Hangover-The,ALAN,What...what am I supposed to do?
8321,Hangover-The,STU,"Wake her up, man!"
8322,Hangover-The,ALAN,Why me?!
8323,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Because she's your spouse, dude! Scowling, Alan slowly crouches down. Then, a little scared, he nudges her. Nothing. He nudges her harder."
8324,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Pinch her tit. It always works. Alan shakes her a bit harder and -- BRRAPPPP -- the girl lets out a massive burp and awakens, COUGHING. Alan jumps back up, terrified. The woman, CHASTITY, looks around, disoriented."
8325,Hangover-The,STU,She seems really cool.
8326,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Yeah, I really like her, man."
8327,Hangover-The,PHIL,"So, um, did you take Alan's name?"
8328,Hangover-The,STU,"Yeah, are you Chastity Mervish now--?"
8329,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Listen to me. Just...did we, or did we not, have sex last night? Alan braces, please say no, please say no... Vick braces, please say yes, please say yes..."
8330,Hangover-The,PHIL,"What a responsible, upstanding young Jew. They don't make `em like that anymore, am I right? Chastity smiles, sweet, as she straps on her 6 inch heels."
8331,Hangover-The,ALAN,Wait-- we didn't use a condom?!
8332,Hangover-The,ALAN,Can someone...please open a window?
8333,Hangover-The,STU,They don't open.
8334,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Yeah, not so much."
8335,Hangover-The,STU,"Dude, I think your wife's mad at you."
8336,Hangover-The,PHIL,"You don't happen to remember what time we met you last night, do you?"
8337,Hangover-The,PHIL,"It's the All-American love story, isn't it? What happened next?"
8338,Hangover-The,PHIL,And was Doug with us then?
8339,Hangover-The,PHIL,Interesting... Do you have any idea where we went after the wedding?
8340,Hangover-The,STU,Work friends?
8341,Hangover-The,ALAN,"You work here? Behind him, Vick SLAPS FIVE with Stu, psyched."
8342,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Look, I don't know how to tell you this, but--"
8343,Hangover-The,STU,Dude.
8344,Hangover-The,PHIL,I know.
8345,Hangover-The,ALAN,"The Holocaust, man. Alan just stares into space. Vick takes him by the shoulder."
8346,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Look, we can get your grandmother's ring back. We just gotta go about it in the right way."
8347,Hangover-The,ALAN,I have besmirched my people.
8348,Hangover-The,STU,"Don't be so hard on yourself, dude-- Just then Chastity runs back over with two BLONDE STRIPPERS."
8349,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Please...don't. Just then a SPOTLIGHT finds Chastity and Alan, and the SLEAZY PONYTAILED DJ up in the booth comes over the P.A. system:"
8350,Hangover-The,ALAN,Twenties?
8351,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Look, I don't know how to say this, but my friends and I were very drunk last night. We would never come to a place like this-- He glances over at Vick and Stu -- but they're gone."
8352,Hangover-The,ALAN,Guys?
8353,Hangover-The,PHIL,You are the best bridesmaids ever.
8354,Hangover-The,STU,Dude: I might not be gay. Then Alan hurries in with Chastity; he looks pissed.
8355,Hangover-The,ALAN,What the hell are you doing?!
8356,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Two-for-ones, man."
8357,Hangover-The,ALAN,We don't have time for this! We gotta find Doug!
8358,Hangover-The,PHIL,What do you think we're doing?
8359,Hangover-The,ALAN,What?
8360,Hangover-The,PHIL,"We're getting into the mindset of last night, to see if it sparks any memories. Now: is this exactly how you were dancing for me last night, Starr? She nods. Vick nods, pensive, scientific."
8361,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Yeah, still no memories. Keep going -- and put your back into it."
8362,Hangover-The,ALAN,"You are so goddamn selfish, Vick. You really are. Stu, let's go."
8363,Hangover-The,PHIL,"No. Stu, sit and enjoy your dance. Stu looks between them, torn."
8364,Hangover-The,ALAN,Dude: Doug is missing! We have less than 18 hours til his wedding! We do not have time for this!
8365,Hangover-The,PHIL,"I'm trying to save your life here, Alan Mervish."
8366,Hangover-The,ALAN,Vick--!
8367,Hangover-The,PHIL,"I'm not kidding, man! Life is one long series of emergencies, and if you don't learn to stop and have a little fun along the way, you're gonna grow into a joyless old prick like your dad. I'm sorry to bring Moshe Mervish into it, but it had to be said. Now yes, we have 18 hours to find Doug -- which means we can afford to spend ten minutes celebrating the special talents of these gifted young body-artists. So sit down, have a jager shot, and smell the goddamn roses for once in your miserable life. Chastity, honey? When you're ready? Chastity pushes Alan onto the red leather banquette and starts dancing for him. He tries to squirm away:"
8368,Hangover-The,ALAN,"No, look-- I am like totally against this, morally and politically. Plus Becky specifically asked me not to--"
8369,Hangover-The,STU,I think I know why he married her.
8370,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Because if he hadn't, I would've. They continue watching on in silence."
8371,Hangover-The,STU,Is it weird that we're sitting this close watching?
8372,Hangover-The,PHIL,Not for me. More watching in silence.
8373,Hangover-The,STU,I really shouldn't be here. I have daughters. Then both of their heads angle the same way.
8374,Hangover-The,PHIL,Not that can do that.
8375,Hangover-The,STU,How can she do that without dislocating her hip?
8376,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Because she's been touched by God. They continue staring, amazed. Just then, the door is kicked open and KIKIOLANI and KALOLO FANALUA burst into the Champagne Room, peering through the darkness, looking for our guys. Vick and Stu see them immediately."
8377,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Shit. They both hop up. Alan remains sitting, however, hypnotized by Chastity. Vick grabs him."
8378,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Alan, come on, man, we gotta go!"
8379,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Whoa, whoa, I'm smelling the roses-- Vick literally yanks Alan up from the banquette."
8380,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Come on, man! We got company! Finally, the Guamians spot the guys and lumber for them!"
8381,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Chastity, honey, is there a back way out of here?! Thinking fast, Chastity grabs her clothes and darts over to a darkened, unlabeled FIRE DOOR."
8382,Hangover-The,STU,Did she just do that in heels?!
8383,Hangover-The,PHIL,"I'm really starting to like this girl. The guys all follow suit, sprinting down the runway and leaping over the patrons! Then the Guamians blow through the curtain, panting, very upset. They lumber down the stage -- and the patrons at the end of the runway clear the hell out of the way."
8384,Hangover-The,STU,Did you see them trample those tiny Japanese businessmen?! I think they killed like four of them! Everyone laughs. Vick puts his arm around Alan.
8385,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Come on, Alan: tell me that wasn't just a little fun..."
8386,Hangover-The,ALAN,"That was...a little fun. Vick smiles -- just as a LAS VEGAS POLICE CAR hops the curb, lights flashing, and cuts them off! Two mustachioed COPS get out and hurry for them, pointing, intense."
8387,Hangover-The,PHIL,No idea.
8388,Hangover-The,PHIL,Ditto. Officer Bladen SLAMS the table with his fist.
8389,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Whatever we did, we're so sorry!"
8390,Hangover-The,STU,"Honestly, man, I will confess to anything you want!"
8391,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Stu: stop talking. Alan: sit up straight. Officer Merriweather, I've told you twelve times now: we have no memory of last night. Now either charge us with a crime, or let us go. Merriweather scowls and nods at Bladen, who steps over to a TELEVISION and turns it on. Merriweather, meanwhile, pulls out a photograph of a slick ASIAN MAN in a red suit, slides it onto the table."
8392,Hangover-The,ALAN,Nothing?
8393,Hangover-The,STU,Who is he?
8394,Hangover-The,ALAN,Oh my god--
8395,Hangover-The,STU,Did we kill someone last night--?!
8396,Hangover-The,PHIL,We have no idea who this man is.
8397,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Yeah, that's right. ON THE TELEVISION, grainy surveillance camera footage of a birthday party starts playing. In the video, JIMMY LANG sits in an upscale restaurant, in front of a BIRTHDAY CAKE, as a table full of hip ASIAN GUYS serenade him with ""Happy Birthday To You."" When the guys sitting next to Jimmy lean forward to help him blow out the candles on his cake, however, we see that it's Vick, ALAN, STU, DOUG, and some BLACK GUY, all very drunk!"
8398,Hangover-The,PHIL,"I love you, Jimmy Lang! Merriweather FREEZES FRAME on Vick kissing the top of Jimmy Lang's shaved head. In the interrogation room, Vick, Stu and Alan sit, frozen. Silence."
8399,Hangover-The,STU,"We're in a lot of trouble, aren't we."
8400,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Officers, I swear, we have no memory of that ever occurring--"
8401,Hangover-The,STU,"Oh no, sir, please don't!"
8402,Hangover-The,ALAN,We have a very important wedding--!
8403,Hangover-The,PHIL,"I know Jimmy Lang. Everyone stops, looks at Vick."
8404,Hangover-The,ALAN,You do?!
8405,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Jimmy and I tried to raise capital for Girl-nasium, a 24 hour fitness center and day spa for tween-age girls, but it never got off the ground. It was an entirely legitimate enterprise -- I had no idea he was a criminal. We must've bumped into him last night, and he must've invited us to join his birthday celebration. No crime in that, is there, Officers? Merriweather gets in Vick's face, intense."
8406,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Stu might. Stu shakes his head, unbelievable."
8407,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Now: are you gonna charge us with something, or are we free to go? The cops look at each other, scowling. Beat."
8408,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Oh, thank you, Officers!"
8409,Hangover-The,STU,It was really nice meeting you--!
8410,Hangover-The,ALAN,Did you have to be such a dick?!
8411,Hangover-The,PHIL,"We got out, didn't we?"
8412,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Yeah, four hours later! If we'd just cooperated with them--"
8413,Hangover-The,PHIL,"If we'd cooperated with them, we'd be in jail right now, Alan. They reach the curb, and Stu starts trying to hail a cab. Desperation is setting in."
8414,Hangover-The,ALAN,What are we gonna do now? We've got zero leads on where Doug is!
8415,Hangover-The,STU,"Why hasn't he called? It's 8:30. The guys shake their heads, I don't know."
8416,Hangover-The,STU,Do you think he's okay--?
8417,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Stu, don't. Doug is fine."
8418,Hangover-The,STU,"I mean, we were hanging out with mobsters last night, man! They kill people for looking at `em weird--!"
8419,Hangover-The,PHIL,Stu: Doug is fine.
8420,Hangover-The,STU,"Or what if we like drove Doug out to the desert and left him, just as like a funny prank--?!"
8421,Hangover-The,PHIL,Stu! Enough!
8422,Hangover-The,PHIL,What did you just say?
8423,Hangover-The,ALAN,"I said I knew I shouldn't have come this weekend, Vick!"
8424,Hangover-The,PHIL,Is that right?
8425,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Yeah, that's right. I only came because Doug insisted. Vick steps towards Alan, heated."
8426,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Why do think you're so much better than us, dude?!"
8427,Hangover-The,ALAN,"I don't -- I just think I'm better than you, Vick! And trust me, it's not that hard! You haven't changed one bit since high school! Jesus, you're 28 years old and you still talk back to cops?! Really?!"
8428,Hangover-The,PHIL,"You're out of your depth, Alan--"
8429,Hangover-The,ALAN,"And you're still the one getting us in trouble! Only then it was hiding your weed in our locker, and now you've got us partying with wanted felons! It's not cute anymore, man! We're too old for this! Vick scowls; this is actually hitting home..."
8430,Hangover-The,ALAN,And all your stupid get-rich-quick schemes?! Girl-nasium?! Custard?! In Los Angeles?! Are you joking?!
8431,Hangover-The,STU,"Okay, let's all take a breath--"
8432,Hangover-The,ALAN,"When's the last time you had a real job, man?! When's the last time you had a girlfriend?! Hell, when's the last time you picked up the check?!"
8433,Hangover-The,PHIL,What's so great about any of those things?!
8434,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Those ""things,"" Vick, are what grown men do! Vick swallows, furious."
8435,Hangover-The,STU,"Look, we're all tired and hungry--"
8436,Hangover-The,PHIL,"None of us ever liked you, Alan! We only hung out with you because Doug made us! Alan recoils, whoa, stung. This is clearly news to him."
8437,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Stu...? Is that true? Stu gestures, uncomfortable, enh, who's to say? Alan nods, I see, his face reddening."
8438,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Why would anyone like you, dude? Have you ever thought about that? You're uptight, you're judgemental, you're cheap, and yet somehow you think you're sweeter than everyone else! Well look around, man: no one wants to be you! I'd rather be Stu than you!"
8439,Hangover-The,STU,"Wait, what--? Too late: Alan charges Vick and TACKLES him onto the lawn! They roll on the ground, trying to punch each other, but it ends up being a mess of half-chops, pulled hair, and hands in each other's faces..."
8440,Hangover-The,ALAN,I've...always...hated you...
8441,Hangover-The,PHIL,"You punch like...your sister... Stu runs over and jumps in, trying to break them apart."
8442,Hangover-The,STU,"Hey, no! Time out! We all need a time out--! THUNK! Stu is accidentally kicked in the face and goes down. Alan and Vick continue rolling on the lawn, trying to beat the crap out of each other. They could be kids again. Then, just when it starts getting way too intense,"
8443,Hangover-The,STU,"Good call on happy hour, Chastity. These tacos kick ass."
8444,Hangover-The,ALAN,Hey -- how'd you start Vick's car?
8445,Hangover-The,PHIL,"That's funny, because Alan's daddy taught him tax law. Chastity smiles, a little confused. Alan is quick to retort:"
8446,Hangover-The,ALAN,And Vick's daddy taught him how to get really drunk at his kid's soccer games and then piss himself.
8447,Hangover-The,PHIL,"It's a disease, dude--!"
8448,Hangover-The,STU,"Guys, come on! For Doug?"
8449,Hangover-The,STU,"""Number blocked."""
8450,Hangover-The,ALAN,What if it's Doug?
8451,Hangover-The,PHIL,What if it's Tracy?!
8452,Hangover-The,STU,"Good evening, this is Stu!"
8453,Hangover-The,STU,"It's Tracy! Vick glares at Alan. Alan looks away, shit."
8454,Hangover-The,STU,Why is she calling me?!
8455,Hangover-The,PHIL,Because she knows you're the most easily tricked.
8456,Hangover-The,ALAN,We have tell her we lost Doug.
8457,Hangover-The,PHIL,"No we don't! Tell her nothing, Stu! Stu turns back to the phone, rattled."
8458,Hangover-The,STU,"Hey, Trace! W-What's going on?"
8459,Hangover-The,STU,"Wow, that sounds amazing!"
8460,Hangover-The,STU,Ummmm........Hang on. She wants to know where Doug is!
8461,Hangover-The,PHIL,I'm working on it! Buy us some time!
8462,Hangover-The,ALAN,"No, just tell her the truth! Honesty is always the best policy!"
8463,Hangover-The,PHIL,"What are you, retarded?! Honesty is never the best policy! Especially not with brides!"
8464,Hangover-The,STU,"Um, what'd you say?"
8465,Hangover-The,STU,"Yeah, um, hang on. She still wants to know!"
8466,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Okay: tell her Alan got really drunk last night and fell down, and the doctor said not to move him for a few hours, but that we'll be back in time for the wedding."
8467,Hangover-The,ALAN,Why do I have to be the one that fell over drunk?!
8468,Hangover-The,PHIL,"It's a fictitious canard, Alan, get over yourself! Stu: tell her!"
8469,Hangover-The,STU,"Listen, Tracy, Alan fell on a"
8470,Hangover-The,PHIL,Fell over drunk.
8471,Hangover-The,STU,"H-He was drunk. And the doctor -- a different doctor, not the one he fell on -- he said we couldn't move him until the wedding--"
8472,Hangover-The,PHIL,For a few hours! We'll be home before the wedding!
8473,Hangover-The,STU,"But we're going to have the wedding at your home-- Tracy just looks really confused. Exasperated, Vick rips the phone away from Stu."
8474,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Tracy?! Vick! How are ya, hon?"
8475,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Nothing! Stu is a moron. Listen, Alan hurt his back last night, so we're gonna be laid up here for a bit, but I promise we'll have Doug home in time for the wedding, okay?"
8476,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Yes, luckily he had a steel rod surgically implanted up his ass at birth, so the doctors anticipate a complete and swift recovery. Alan flips him the bird."
8477,Hangover-The,PHIL,"What? No! No, you can't actually, Doug...Doug is out."
8478,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Where is he? He's aaaat...the pharmacy. Yeah, picking up Alan's medications. Listen, Trace, I'm losing you, but we'll see you tomorrow, okay? Bye, sweetie--! Vick hangs up and nods confidently."
8479,Hangover-The,PHIL,She bought it.
8480,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Perfect. We just told Tracy we'd have Doug home in 13 hours, and we still have no idea where he is... They pass a DOORMAN on their way out, who's standing with a stamp and a UV light reader."
8481,Hangover-The,PHIL,Maybe we should go back to the hotel and--
8482,Hangover-The,STU,"Oh my God, guys! Look! Stu holds his hand under the UV light -- it's covered in STAMPS from all the clubs they've been to the night before! Stu yanks up his sleeve to reveal his ENTIRE FOREARM GLOWS, completely covered with stamps! The guys hurry back and slide their forearms under the UV light, too: they all have the same stamps! Their eyes alight:"
8483,Hangover-The,ALAN,"It's like a map of last night! The guys look at each other, hope returning to their faces!"
8484,Hangover-The,STU,Where do you want to start?!
8485,Hangover-The,PHIL,At the top! We hit every club we went to til someone remembers what we did with Doug!
8486,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Nice clue, Stuey! I can't believe we're actually gonna pull this off! Stu grins over at the car next to them. Then he stops."
8487,Hangover-The,STU,"Hey: is that guy wearing Doug's hat?! The guys look over to see that the DRIVER of the next car over is, in fact, wearing the DISTINCTIVE FEDORA-STYLE HAT Doug was wearing last night. The guy turns off the Strip."
8488,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Naaah, couldn't be."
8489,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Lots of people have hats like that. Stu nods, yeah, I guess..."
8490,Hangover-The,STU,"All right, this is the last place we went, ""Chaps."" Vick rolls to a stop in front of..."
8491,Hangover-The,STU,"You sure we came here...? Then they look up at the marquee. It reads ""CHAPS: HOME OF"
8492,Hangover-The,ALAN,The Golden Pony. That's us.
8493,Hangover-The,STU,Maybe I'll just wait in the car-- But Vick is already shoving Stu out of the car.
8494,Hangover-The,PHIL,You think we would've remembered this...
8495,Hangover-The,STU,"Yeah, I don't think we came here..."
8496,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Then why is your underwear nailed to the wall? The guys turn to see numerous pairs of MEN'S UNDERWEAR nailed to the wall nearby. A sign above it reads ""CHAPS WALL OF FAME."" We recognize Stu's COLORADO STATE BOXERS."
8497,Hangover-The,STU,Those could be anybody's. Thousands of people go to Colorado State--
8498,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Oh my God, are they autographed?"
8499,Hangover-The,STU,"I am so gay... Just then, a BUFF WAITER in assless chaps blows by, smiling."
8500,Hangover-The,STU,R-Roger?
8501,Hangover-The,ALAN,Stay very close to me. She smiles and dances through the crowd.
8502,Hangover-The,STU,"Oh. G-Good, thanks...?"
8503,Hangover-The,PHIL,"We're going to love you either way, Stu... Stu nods, focussed, nervous, like before a big game."
8504,Hangover-The,ALAN,Some of my best friends are gay.
8505,Hangover-The,STU,Is that true?
8506,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Not...not really? I live in Connecticut, man, we don't even have black people yet. Stu nods, right. Then, after steeling himself, he enters..."
8507,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Excuse me, friend, can you tell me where Roger is?"
8508,Hangover-The,PHIL,"He's cute...I guess...? Stu shrugs, yeah, I guess...? As they draw close, Roger sees them, and smiles."
8509,Hangover-The,STU,Oh my god.
8510,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Listen, man, we don't really remember what happened last night, can you fill us in?"
8511,Hangover-The,STU,Did we...you know...do anything?
8512,Hangover-The,STU,Was I...the boy or the girl?
8513,Hangover-The,PHIL,Wait-- what?!
8514,Hangover-The,PHIL,You insisted?! Why'd you insist?!
8515,Hangover-The,ALAN,I don't know! I don't know why I insisted!
8516,Hangover-The,STU,"I'm really not sure we can be friends anymore... Finally, Chastity starts LAUGHING."
8517,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Not cool, Roger. Not cool."
8518,Hangover-The,ALAN,So what did happen last night?
8519,Hangover-The,ALAN,Really? Doug did?
8520,Hangover-The,PHIL,"The guy from the Jimmy Lang surveillance video. The guys nod, right."
8521,Hangover-The,STU,"No! That's cool, I don't need to see it--"
8522,Hangover-The,PHIL,We must see that video.
8523,Hangover-The,STU,"I'm a Dad, I-I don't get to the gym as much as I'd like..."
8524,Hangover-The,STU,Annnnd that would explain the searing ass pain.
8525,Hangover-The,PHIL,And what time was all this?
8526,Hangover-The,ALAN,And our Doug was with us?
8527,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Wait, so we left with Doug at 4:45, we got back to the hotel at 5:00, and Doug was gone by 5:30 when Chastity met back up with us?"
8528,Hangover-The,STU,That doesn't make any sense.
8529,Hangover-The,PHIL,Did we lose him along the way?
8530,Hangover-The,STU,"He was passed out, how far could he have gone--? Just then, Vick's cellphone rings. The caller ID reads ""MANDALAY BAY."" He answers:"
8531,Hangover-The,PHIL,Hello?
8532,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Atashir, many greetings to you."
8533,Hangover-The,PHIL,What?! Are you sure it's him?!
8534,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Oh thank you, Atashir! You are a man of great honor! A thousand blessings upon your ancestors! Vick SLAMS his phone shut, overjoyed."
8535,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Doug is in the room! A maid just found him! He's passed out, but he's okay!"
8536,Hangover-The,STU,They're sure it's him?!
8537,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Atashir swears it is! The guys all laugh, a massive weight lifted."
8538,Hangover-The,STU,Oh thank God he's okay...
8539,Hangover-The,ALAN,"After all this?! He's in the room?! They keep laughing and hug each other, heartfelt. Vick even hugs Roger."
8540,Hangover-The,PHIL,"I don't even care! Hug me, you big shiny homosexual!"
8541,Hangover-The,ALAN,That was cool of Roger to give you all the tapes of your performance.
8542,Hangover-The,STU,"I know, if I actually was gay, I'd totally date Roger first. What a gentle soul. They get into Vick's clunker."
8543,Hangover-The,PHIL,How we doing on time?
8544,Hangover-The,PHIL,"We'll be in LA by dawn. I told you bitches this would all work out... They drive off into the night, grins all around."
8545,Hangover-The,ALAN,This has officially been the craziest weekend of my life. Thanks for all your help. You were awesome.
8546,Hangover-The,ALAN,"I'm sorry about all this, Chastity."
8547,Hangover-The,ALAN,Beg pardon?
8548,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Okay, well, I'm sorry, Jennifer."
8549,Hangover-The,ALAN,Where you from?
8550,Hangover-The,ALAN,Oh yeah?
8551,Hangover-The,ALAN,You fly out every week?
8552,Hangover-The,ALAN,Kid?
8553,Hangover-The,PHIL,They always have kids.
8554,Hangover-The,ALAN,No kids. Same girlfriend for 14 years. Becky. Alan shows her a photo of Becky on his cellphone.
8555,Hangover-The,STU,We like you way better.
8556,Hangover-The,ALAN,Becky is great.
8557,Hangover-The,STU,Becky collects teapots.
8558,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Yeah, she's a total canwego."
8559,Hangover-The,PHIL,"You know, she's the girl at the party who's always like ""Can we go? Can we go?"" Chastity laughs. Alan does too, shaking his head."
8560,Hangover-The,ALAN,She has low blood sugar.
8561,Hangover-The,STU,She has low fun sugar.
8562,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Jesus, guys! This is the girl I'm going to marry! If, you know...she forgives me for cheating on her..."
8563,Hangover-The,PHIL,Wait: you're going to tell her?
8564,Hangover-The,ALAN,Of course I'm going to tell her! I could never keep something like that from her.
8565,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Dude, she still hasn't forgiven me for scratching her Queensryche CD in sixth grade -- she's neeeeever gonna forgive you for marrying a stripper in Vegas."
8566,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Well, then that's just the price I'm going to have to pay. Alan looks off, stoic. Chastity pats his hand, proud."
8567,Hangover-The,PHIL,"She's gonna cut your dick off, dude."
8568,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Keep `er close, Paco. We'll be right back."
8569,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Doug! Wake up, man!"
8570,Hangover-The,STU,"Uh-oh. The door SLAMS behind them, and they whip around to see KIKIOLANI standing in front of the door, blocking their exit. He has an identical CAST on his right arm."
8571,Hangover-The,STU,"Not good. Just then, a toilet FLUSHES and an immensely large man in a red suit exits the bathroom, drying his hands. We recognize him from his police photo as crime boss JIMMY LANG, 50's."
8572,Hangover-The,PHIL,Where is Doug?
8573,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Listen, Mr. Lang, whatever we did last night, we are incredibly sorry-"
8574,Hangover-The,ALAN,"What's going on, Vick? Vick stammers, trying to find the words..."
8575,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Jesus, Vick..."
8576,Hangover-The,STU,"How could you do this to us, man? We're your best friends... Vick looks away, ashamed."
8577,Hangover-The,PHIL,"They were gonna hurt me, man..."
8578,Hangover-The,PHIL,I can get it! I can! I just--
8579,Hangover-The,PHIL,You have Doug?
8580,Hangover-The,STU,Oh my God...
8581,Hangover-The,PHIL,Yes! Yes. Jimmy nods and heads for the door. The Samoans follow him.
8582,Hangover-The,ALAN,M-M-Mr. Lang?
8583,Hangover-The,ALAN,H-How much does Vick owe?
8584,Hangover-The,ALAN,200 thousand dollars?!
8585,Hangover-The,ALAN,How the hell could you blow that kind of money?!
8586,Hangover-The,STU,Was it for the custard store?
8587,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Jesus, Stu, wake up! There is no custard store! Vick was just trying to rip us off to pay back Jimmy Lang!"
8588,Hangover-The,STU,"Is that true, Vick? Vick just stares out at the city, not denying it."
8589,Hangover-The,STU,Were any of your deals...real?
8590,Hangover-The,STU,"Dude, I manage an Applebee's, that money meant something to me... Vick spins around, furious:"
8591,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Do you really think I wanted my life to turn out like this, Stu?! Do you really think I don't know that I'm a massive loser?!"
8592,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Jesus, you guys got out of high school and you just knew what to do, you went to college and got good jobs and found cool wives and made beautiful children -- what do I have to show for the last decade of my life?! Nothing! Vick swats a lamp off a nearby end-table -- it SMASHES against the wall! The guys freeze. Tense silence. Vick grows emotional."
8593,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Jesus, I'm almost 30, and the only thing I really have...the only thing I really have is you guys."
8594,Hangover-The,STU,"Come on, Vick--"
8595,Hangover-The,PHIL,"No, man, it's true! I put on a good show, but my life is so goddamn hollow and vapid and lonely, it scares me, man. I-I don't know how much longer I can keep this scam going. And now I've gone and ruined the one good thing I had... Tears threaten in his eyes. He wipes at them, angry."
8596,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Just...please don't give up on me, okay? I-I don't know what I'd do without you guys. I really don't... Alan and Stu exchange a look. They've never seen brash, cocky Vick this vulnerable before. Stu can't help but give in."
8597,Hangover-The,STU,"Come on, man, we've been bro's since third grade, it's gonna take a lot more than money to ruin our friendship. Vick looks down, deeply touched..."
8598,Hangover-The,STU,"What I don't understand is why you didn't just ask me for the money. I would've given you every last cent I had, man..."
8599,Hangover-The,STU,"I love you, man."
8600,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Love you too, bro. Love you too. They hug tight. For a while."
8601,Hangover-The,STU,"Also, I banged your sister sophomore year. Vick pulls away."
8602,Hangover-The,PHIL,What?!
8603,Hangover-The,STU,"Sorry. Just seemed like a good time to tell you. Vick stammers at Stu, speechless."
8604,Hangover-The,STU,"She had just broken up with that guy from Central, we were playing ""I Never"" at Tim Donahee's pool, one thing lead to another--"
8605,Hangover-The,PHIL,"No! No. That's...that's plenty. Vick desperately tries to clear the image from his mind. Alan just frowns at his watch, stressed."
8606,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Look, I'm glad we're all sharing, but we've got three hours to come up with 200 grand, or else... The guys nod, frowning, back on point."
8607,Hangover-The,ALAN,"I'd offer to take a loan out, but it's 3 o'clock in the morning, I'm pretty sure my bank is closed."
8608,Hangover-The,STU,I think I can get a 20 grand cash advance on my credit card...
8609,Hangover-The,ALAN,So that just leaves 180 grand... The guys frown at each other.
8610,Hangover-The,STU,Time check!
8611,Hangover-The,PHIL,12 minutes.
8612,Hangover-The,STU,Chip check!
8613,Hangover-The,STU,Faster! Come on chip check!
8614,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Dude, how many Red Bulls have you had?"
8615,Hangover-The,STU,I stopped counting at six! I can hear my heart beating in my head! Alan finishes counting the chips -- and frowns.
8616,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Just over 100 grand. The guys wince, damn."
8617,Hangover-The,PHIL,There's only one thing left to do. They all exchange a knowing look...
8618,Hangover-The,STU,You sure we don't want red?! What if the ball lands on red--!
8619,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Shut up, Stu."
8620,Hangover-The,STU,I can't watch! My heart's gonna explode! Can your heart even explode?! Because I think my heart is gonna explode! I can't watch! The ball lands. Dead silence.
8621,Hangover-The,STU,"It's red, isn't it?! I knew it! Tell me it's not red!"
8622,Hangover-The,ALAN,"It's not red... Stu turns, ecstatic--"
8623,Hangover-The,ALAN,"It's green. The ball has stopped on green, DOUBLE ZERO. Stu clutches his chest, like he's having a seizure. Vick inhales, grim. Alan slowly drops to his knees. Chastity closes her eyes. Their HUGE PILE OF CHIPS is raked off the table..."
8624,Hangover-The,ALAN,No...It might get a little dangerous. I wouldn't want... He trails off. Chastity nods.
8625,Hangover-The,ALAN,Thanks for all your help. Awkward silence. The cold desert wind blows.
8626,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Yeah, probably not... Alan looks genuinely sad."
8627,Hangover-The,PHIL,"We gotta go, man. Alan nods, yeah, and gets in the car..."
8628,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Yep, just driving out to the middle of desert to meet some mobsters, what could possibly go wrong...? The guys all frown."
8629,Hangover-The,STU,So what's our plan?
8630,Hangover-The,ALAN,"I think we should tell Mr. Lang that we couldn't get the money, but that, if he's amenable, we could create a payment calendar--"
8631,Hangover-The,PHIL,"We're gonna give Jimmy a dummy bag of money, grab Doug, and make a run for it."
8632,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Yes, good! What an airtight plan--!"
8633,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Jimmy Lang doesn't do payment calendars, Alan! Trust me: this is our only shot of getting Doug back! Left turn! Vick skids onto Highway 12 -- a barely labelled dirt road. Things are quickly going from bad to worse..."
8634,Hangover-The,PHIL,"This all the cash we got? The guys frown at their empty wallets, yeah. We are"
8635,Hangover-The,ALAN,This is the dumbest plan ever.
8636,Hangover-The,PHIL,Alan I need you positive please.
8637,Hangover-The,STU,"Here they come. They all look up to see a WHITE YUKON approaching on the far horizon, kicking up a trail of dust. The guys tense up."
8638,Hangover-The,PHIL,Stuart?
8639,Hangover-The,STU,Yeah?
8640,Hangover-The,PHIL,"There's an emergency bottle of tequila in my glove box. Get it out please. Stu opens the glovebox, pulls out a bottle of Patron. He opens it, takes a swig, then passes it to Vick, who takes a pull and passes it to Alan, who also drinks. They all watch the white Yukon draw ever closer."
8641,Hangover-The,ALAN,I can't believe this is how we're going to die... The Yukon pulls up about ten yards away. No one moves. The Yukon's doors open... The Cadillac's doors open... TIGHT ON the Jimmy Lang's RED BOOT as it hits the road...
8642,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Let's see Doug! Jimmy Lang nods to Kalolo, who opens the back door of the Yukon and pulls out a GUY with his hands tied behind his back and a plastic RALPH'S BAG over his head; he struggles a bit. The guys look a bit alarmed."
8643,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Jesus, what'd they do to him?"
8644,Hangover-The,PHIL,Pull off the Ralph's bag! Jimmy yanks the bag off of the guy's head to reveal
8645,Hangover-The,PHIL,Who the hell is that?!
8646,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Oh my God: it's the other Doug! Roger's friend, the cake designer!"
8647,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Yeah, you got the wrong Doug, man!"
8648,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Yeah, man, our Doug is white!"
8649,Hangover-The,PHIL,"I don't know what to tell you, bro, this isn't the Doug we requested!"
8650,Hangover-The,ALAN,Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God...
8651,Hangover-The,PHIL,Christ that hurts!
8652,Hangover-The,ALAN,I'm being shot at! I'm being shot at!
8653,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Oh my god, is he okay?!"
8654,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Who cares! Go go! Alan floors the car while Stu and Vick SPRINT and DIVE in! The caddy peels the hell out of there, kicking up rocks and dust! The Guamians FIRE after them!"
8655,Hangover-The,STU,I can't believe you just saved my life!
8656,Hangover-The,PHIL,"I can't believe you just drove my car into Jimmy Lang! Alan drives, his eyes as big as saucers."
8657,Hangover-The,STU,He's gonna be really upset!
8658,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Yeah, I was just thinking that!"
8659,Hangover-The,ALAN,Now can we call Tracy?
8660,Hangover-The,PHIL,Yeah. It's probably time.
8661,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Who wants to make the call? Beat. Then Vick reaches for his nose, odd man out. Stu and Alan immediately reach for their noses, too. It's close."
8662,Hangover-The,STU,That was you!
8663,Hangover-The,ALAN,What?! No! I beat you by a mile!
8664,Hangover-The,STU,"Vick, who won?!"
8665,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Well, I'll be damned... Vick grabs the bottle of Patron, takes a long swig. Beat."
8666,Hangover-The,PHIL,"I still can't believe Stu banged my sister. Vick hands the bottle to Alan, gets out, and makes for the pay phone..."
8667,Hangover-The,PHIL,"In the desert, on the pay phone, looking through his busted aviators into the rising sun."
8668,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Tracy, it's Vick."
8669,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Listen, honey...The bachelor party got a little out of control and, well...we lost Doug."
8670,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Yeah, that's not gonna happen..."
8671,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Look, I'm really sorry, Trace. This is all my fault--"
8672,Hangover-The,PHIL,"What the--?! Alan gets on the phone with Tracy, his heart racing."
8673,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Tracy, it's Alan! Hey, Vick is just joking around! We've got Doug right here! Vick looks like: what?!"
8674,Hangover-The,ALAN,"I know, Vick is such a prick! We'll see you at the wedding! Bye! Alan hangs up and races back to the car. Vick follows."
8675,Hangover-The,PHIL,What are you doing?
8676,Hangover-The,ALAN,I know where Doug is!
8677,Hangover-The,ALAN,Remember when we saw Doug's bed impaled on the griffin thing?!
8678,Hangover-The,STU,"Yeah, we threw it out the window."
8679,Hangover-The,ALAN,"No: the windows don't open, remember?!"
8680,Hangover-The,PHIL,So how did--?
8681,Hangover-The,STU,I don't get it.
8682,Hangover-The,ALAN,And that's why we've been seeing Doug's clothes all over Vegas! He was trying to signal someone!
8683,Hangover-The,PHIL,I don't believe it...
8684,Hangover-The,STU,I-I still don't get it--
8685,Hangover-The,ALAN,"And it totally jives with the timeline, right?! We brought Doug back to the hotel at 5:00, he was passed out..."
8686,Hangover-The,PHIL,It's so obvious!
8687,Hangover-The,STU,Not...to me...so much?
8688,Hangover-The,PHIL,How'd you figure it out?!
8689,Hangover-The,ALAN,"The Patron, man! It reminded me of our first drink of the night!"
8690,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Honestly, dude, you're a genius."
8691,Hangover-The,PHIL,"He's on the roof! Stu looks confused, the roof?"
8692,Hangover-The,ALAN,"After Doug passed out, we must've taken him up there in his bed as a prank, so he'd wake up on the roof or whatever? Then we forgot him."
8693,Hangover-The,PHIL,"And all day he's been throwing his crap off the roof, trying to signal someone to get him down!"
8694,Hangover-The,STU,You think he's still up there?!
8695,Hangover-The,ALAN,Only one way to find out...
8696,Hangover-The,STU,"Oh my god, I'm so glad you're okay!"
8697,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Okay, no, that's cool!"
8698,Hangover-The,STU,"Yeah, you have every right to be upset! We validate your anger!"
8699,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Why'd you do it, sweet Atashir?! Why did you betray us?!"
8700,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Fair enough! See you next time, you beautiful Judas! They blow out of the hotel..."
8701,Hangover-The,ALAN,No flights to LA with empty seats!
8702,Hangover-The,STU,"Well, we can't drive! It's 350 miles to LA and the wedding starts at 10, which is in--"
8703,Hangover-The,STU,"--three hours! Beat. Then Vick, Stu and Alan exchange a look...a smile slowly creeps across their faces."
8704,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Look, Doug, I think I speak for everyone in the car when I say I'm really sorry about locking you on the roof of the hotel."
8705,Hangover-The,STU,"You gotta admit, it's a pretty funny prank... I mean, up until the part when we forgot all about you. Doug just stares out at the desert in stony silence."
8706,Hangover-The,STU,He's still not talking to us.
8707,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Totally understandable, man. Whenever you're ready..."
8708,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Sorry, Mapquest took us a crazy route. We ready to do this thing? The bridesmaids sit up, stunned."
8709,Hangover-The,PHIL,"She looks beautiful, man."
8710,Hangover-The,PHIL,That's cool. I get it.
8711,Hangover-The,PHIL,"We did it, fellahs. We pulled it off."
8712,Hangover-The,ALAN,"I never had a doubt. They LAUGH. Alan smiles, more relaxed than we've ever seen him. They sip champagne and watch Doug and Tracy enjoy their first dance on the dance floor."
8713,Hangover-The,STU,You think Doug's ever going to talk to us again?
8714,Hangover-The,PHIL,Give him time.
8715,Hangover-The,ALAN,Yeah. Like a decade or two-- Then Stu sees someone approaching over Alan's shoulder.
8716,Hangover-The,STU,Uh-oh. The guys all look over to see
8717,Hangover-The,PHIL,Hey Beck--!
8718,Hangover-The,ALAN,"I-I'm so sorry, I can explain-- Then there's a WOMAN'S VOICE behind them."
8719,Hangover-The,PHIL,This just got complicated...
8720,Hangover-The,ALAN,Jennifer? Chastity smiles that he called her by her real name.
8721,Hangover-The,ALAN,"She's my wife. Becky's jaw drops. Chastity smiles slightly. Stu and Vick grin, oh shit!"
8722,Hangover-The,ALAN,"We don't make each other happy anymore, Beck. And we can keep not making each other happy for another 14 years -- hell, maybe even another 50 years -- but let's not. Let's find people who make our hearts race. Let's be excited and fun and alive again... Alan looks at Becky, sincere, honest. Beat."
8723,Hangover-The,ALAN,"I'm sorry, Beck. I really am. Can I buy you a free drink? Chastity smiles, takes his arm, and they walk off together towards the bar."
8724,Hangover-The,ALAN,"Let's start with dinner, and see where it goes...?"
8725,Hangover-The,STU,"Oh, I missed you guys so much!"
8726,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Okay, okay, I'll go with you. Just...don't ruin the wedding. Then JIMMY LANG enters the bathroom on RED CRUTCHES."
8727,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Um, what...?"
8728,Hangover-The,PHIL,"I will pay you back, you know."
8729,Hangover-The,ALAN,Damn straight you will! They all LAUGH.
8730,Hangover-The,PHIL,"Well, Alan married a stripper, Stu went gay, and I learned a very important life lesson from an obese hoodlum."
8731,Hangover-The,STU,We'll tell you the whole story when you get back from your honeymoon.
8732,Hangover-The,ALAN,"We really are sorry, man. Doug nods, I know. Vick raises his cocktail."
8733,Hangover-The,PHIL,To Doug and Tracy.
8734,Hangover-The,STU,To Doug and Tracy.
8735,Hangover-The,ALAN,To Doug and Tracy.
8736,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"This, is Berk. It's twelve days North of hopeless, and a few degrees South of freezing to death. It's located solidly on the meridian of misery. The camera drifts over rolling hills to reveal a small village nestled on an outcropping of sea mounts."
8737,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"My village. In a word, sturdy. And it's been here for seven generations, but every single building is new. The camera drifts closer, circling."
8738,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"We have fishing, hunting, and a charming view of the sunsets. The only problems are the pests. You see, most places have mice or mosquitos. We have... Sheep graze peacefully on a hillside. Suddenly one is snatched."
8739,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,...dragons.
8740,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Most people would leave. Not us. We're Vikings. We have stubbornness issues. Vikings sound the alarm. Viking men and women pour out into the streets, axes in hand. ON HICCUP darting through alleys, staying under eaves, making his way through the battle."
8741,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"My name's Hiccup. Great name, I know. But it's not the worst. Parents believe a hideous name will frighten off gnomes and trolls. Like our charming Viking demeanor wouldn't do that. Dragons sweep back and forth, dodging axes and blasting the Vikings who throw them. A burly warrior gets tossed in an explosion, knocking Hiccup to the ground."
8742,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Meet the neighbors. Hoark the Haggard...
8743,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,... Burnthair the Broad...
8744,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,... Phlegma the Fierce...
8745,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,". Ack. He passes a silent ox of a viking, picking his ear."
8746,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Yep, just Ack. Enter STOICK, the biggest Viking of all. He yanks Hiccup from the path of a strafing dragon and holds aloft to the crowd."
8747,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Hiccup!? What is he doing out again?!
8748,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Yes I do. An EXPLOSION forces Vikings to DUCK. Stoick stands firm, brushing flaming debris off of his shoulder."
8749,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,What have we got?
8750,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Any Night Furies?
8751,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Who me? Nah, come on! I'm way too muscular for their taste. They wouldn't know what to do with all this. Hiccup strikes a bodybuilder pose."
8752,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,The meathead with attitude and interchangeable hands is Gobber. I've been his apprentice ever since I was little. Well...littler.
8753,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,We move to the lower defenses. We'll counter-attack with the catapults.
8754,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,See? Old village. Lots and lots of new houses.
8755,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Oh and that's Fishlegs, Snotlout. The twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut. And..."
8756,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Their job is so much cooler. Hiccup tries to join them as they pass, but he's hooked by Gobber and hoisted back inside."
8757,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon. My life will get infinitely better. I might even get a date."
8758,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Okay fine, but... He rushes to the back corner of the stall and presents a bizarre, wheel barrow-like contraption."
8759,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"... this will throw it for me. Hiccup OPENS the hinged lid of the device. An arm springs up, equipped with twin bows. They prematurely launch a bola, narrowly missing Gobber... and taking out a Viking at the counter."
8760,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Mild calibration issue.
8761,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"You, sir, are playing a dangerous game. Keeping this much, raw...Vikingness contained."
8762,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,One day I'll get out there. Because killing a dragon is everything around here.
8763,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"A Nadder head is sure to get me at least noticed. The Nadders clamber onto the building, tearing the roof and walls apart. Sheep pour out and SCATTER. Elsewhere, hippo-like Gronckles pick drying racks clean of fish and fly off like loaded pelicans."
8764,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Gronckles are tough. Taking down one of those would definitely get me a girlfriend. A stealthy, snake-like dragon head peeks over a rooftop, breathing gas into a chimney."
8765,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"A Zippelback? Exotic, exciting. Two heads, twice the status. A second head pokes through the door and lights it. KABLAM! The two heads fly through the explosion, their necks zipping together to reveal a single body. It flies past Stoick as he climbs to the top of a CATAPULT"
8766,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"And then there's the Monstrous Nightmare. Only the best Vikings go after those. They have this nasty habit of setting themselves on fire. It emerges from the flames, climbing the catapult with a leering, toothy grin."
8767,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Reload! I'll take care of this. Stoick takes on the Nightmare, face to hammer. Suddenly, a LOUD BALLISTIC MOANING streaks overhead. The catapult crew ducks."
8768,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,But the ultimate prize is the dragon no one has ever seen. We call it the--
8769,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"This thing never steals food, never shows itself, and... The sound recedes, leaving the crippled catapult in flames."
8770,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,...never misses.
8771,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,I know. Be right back!
8772,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Mind yourselves! The devils still have some juice in them.
8773,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Oh I hit it! Yes, I hit it! Did anybody see that? Hiccup's victory is short-lived. A Monstrous Nightmare appears, slithering up over the lip of the cliff."
8774,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Except for you. ON STOICK, holding down the netted Nadders. He hears a familiar HOLLER and looks up to see... HICCUP running through the PLAZA, SCREAMING, with the NIGHTMARE fast on his heels. Alarmed, Stoick abandons the Nadders and runs off."
8775,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"(to his men, re: the"
8776,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"You're all out. He smashes the Nightmare repeatedly in the face, driving it away. It takes to the air and disappears. Winded, Stoick turns to Hiccup."
8777,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Oh, and there's one more thing you need to know..."
8778,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Sorry, dad."
8779,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"It's not like the last few times, Dad. I mean I really actually hit it. You guys were busy and I had a very clear shot. It went down, just off Raven Point. Let's get a search party out there, before it--"
8780,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"--STOP! Just....stop. He releases Hiccup. Everyone goes silent, staring expectantly."
8781,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Every time you step outside, disaster follows. Can you not see that I have bigger problems? Winter's almost here and I have an entire village to feed! Hiccup looks around. All eyes are upon him."
8782,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Between you and me, the village could do with a little less feeding, don't ya think? A few rotund Vikings stir self-consciously."
8783,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"This isn't a joke, Hiccup!"
8784,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"I can't stop myself. I see a dragon and I have to just... kill it, you know? It's who I am, Dad."
8785,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"You are many things, Hiccup. But a dragon killer is not one of them. Sting. Hiccup looks around to see many nods of agreement."
8786,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Get back to the house.
8787,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Thank you, thank you. I was trying, so... Hiccup avoids Astrid's glare and heads up toward a large house, standing prominently on the hill above the others."
8788,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,I really did hit one.
8789,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,He never listens.
8790,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"And when he does, it's always with this... disappointed scowl. Like someone skimped on the meat in his sandwich."
8791,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Thank you, for summing that up. They reach the doorway."
8792,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"I just want to be one of you guys. Gobber eyes him sympathetically. Hiccup turns and goes through the front door. And straight out the back door. He hurries off into the woods, determined."
8793,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Either we finish them or they'll finish us! It's the only way we'll be rid of them! If we find the nest and destroy it, the dragons will leave. They'll find another home."
8794,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Alright. Those who stay will look after Hiccup. Hands jut into the air, volunteers galore. Enthusiastic murmurs of prep and packing fill the room."
8795,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"No, I need you to stay and train some new recruits."
8796,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,What am I going to do with him Gobber?
8797,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"No, I'm serious."
8798,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,He'd be killed before you let the first dragon out of its cage.
8799,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"I do know that, actually."
8800,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"No, actually I do."
8801,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Listen! You know what he's like. From the time he could crawl he's been...different. He doesn't listen.
8802,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Has the attention span of a sparrow. I take him fishing and he goes hunting for... for trolls.
8803,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,When I was a boy...
8804,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"My father told me to bang my head against a rock and I did it. I thought it was crazy, but I didn't question him. And you know what happened?"
8805,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"That rock split in two. It taught me what a Viking could do, Gobber. He could crush mountains, level forests, tame seas! Even as a boy, I knew what I was, what I had to become."
8806,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Uggh, the gods hate me. Some people lose their knife or their mug. No, not me. I manage to lose an entire dragon. Hiccup WHACKS a low-hanging branch. It SNAPS back at him, hitting him in the face. He looks up to see a snapped tree trunk. His eyes follow it to a long trench of up-turned earth. He follows it to a downed, black dragon, its body and tail tangled in a bola. It appears dead. Hiccup approaches, beaming."
8807,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,I have brought down this mighty beast! It suddenly shifts.
8808,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Whoa! Hiccup springs back, terrified. He turns his blade on it. Rattled, Hiccup creeps along the length of the weak, wounded dragon, dagger poised to strike. As he reaches the head, Hiccup finds the Night Fury staring coldly at him. Hiccup tries to look away, but he's drawn back to its unnerving, unflinching stare. With the dragon safety tangled in the ropes, Hiccup jabs with his dagger, puffing himself up with false bravado."
8809,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"I'm going to kill you, Dragon. I'm gonna cut out your heart and take it to my father. I'm a Viking."
8810,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"I did this. He turns to leave. Pauses. And glances back at the dragon, chest heaving. Hiccup GRUMBLES. He checks over his shoulder to ensure that no one is watching... then hurries back to cut the ropes. The Night Fury's eye shoots open. With the dragon watching his every move, Hiccup hurriedly saws through the bola ropes. As the last rope falls free, the Night Fury suddenly POUNCES! In a blur, the dragon is upon him, pinning Hiccup down, grazing his neck. Looking like it's about to kill him. Hiccup is paralyzed. The dragon's breath ruffles his hair. Hiccup opens his eyes to find the Night Fury's wolf-like stare boring into him. The exchange is intense, profound. The dragon draws a deep breath, as though it's about to torch him, then lets out an ear-piercing scream instead. It turns and takes flight, flapping violently through the canopy of trees. It bashes against a nearby mountain side, recovers, and drops out of view some distance away. Winded, Hiccup struggles to his feet, staggers a few steps, collapses to his knees, and faints."
8811,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Hiccup.
8812,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"I, uh... I have to talk to you, Dad."
8813,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"I need to speak with you too, son. Hiccup and Stoick STRAIGHTEN at the same moment."
8814,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,You go first.
8815,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"No, you go first."
8816,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Alright. You get your wish. Dragon training. You start in the morning.
8817,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,--You'll need this. Stoick hands Hiccup his axe. Hiccup avoids taking it.
8818,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,I don't want to fight dragons.
8819,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Come on. Yes, you do."
8820,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Rephrase. Dad I can't kill dragons.
8821,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,But you will kill dragons.
8822,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"No, I'm really very extra sure that I won't."
8823,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,It's time Hiccup.
8824,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Can you not hear me?
8825,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,This is serious son! Stoick forces the axe into Hiccup's hands. Its weight drags him down. He looks up to see Stoick under-lit with firelight.
8826,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,When you carry this axe... you carry all of us with you. Which means you walk like us. You talk like us. You think like us. No more of...
8827,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,You just gestured to all of me.
8828,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Deal?
8829,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,This conversation is feeling very one-sided.
8830,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Good. Train hard. I'll be back. Probably.
8831,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"And I'll be here. Maybe. Stoick heads out the door, leaving Hiccup holding the axe."
8832,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Yeah, no kidding, right? Pain. Love it. The recruits turn to see Hiccup behind them. Groans all around."
8833,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,A doctor?
8834,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Well this was stupid. SUDDENLY, the NIGHT FURY blasts past him. Hiccup recoils, watching the massive beast struggle to climb the walls. It flaps violently, then peels away to a rough landing. The dragon is trapped. Hiccup grins, excited to see it again, and slips closer. He watches as the dragon, exhausted and frustrated, leaps into the air, beating its wings furiously. Again and again, it rolls uncontrolled and CRASHES heavily. As if remembering to snap a photo, Hiccup pulls a leather- bound book and flips past drawings of weapons to a blank page. He sketches the dragon quickly, desperate to record the image. The Fury claws at the steep rock walls, trying climb out of the cove. It SLIPS and falls hard, crushing several saplings. The Fury rolls back to his feet and slowly crawls to the water's edge. He spots fish in the shallow water and snaps at them... but comes up empty. He lowers his head, looking weakened."
8835,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,So I guess we'll share--
8836,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"All mine then. Wow, so okay. I'll"
8837,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Tomorrow.
8838,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Dragon classifications. Strike class. Fear class. Mystery class. Hiccup turns the page.
8839,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.
8840,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"When startled, the Thunderdrum produces a concussive sound that can kill a man at close range. Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight. Hiccup's eyes drift to a lurid illustration of decapitated Vikings. Another page, another dragon."
8841,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Timberjack. This gigantic creature has razor sharp wings that can slice through full grown trees...extremely dangerous. Kill on sight. The illustrations seem to take on a life of their own, shifting and squirming in the candlelight."
8842,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Scauldron. Sprays scalding water at its victim. Extremely dangerous. The storm outside rages against the shuttered windows. Hiccup is startled, but presses on."
8843,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Changewing. Even newly hatched dragons can spray acid. Kill on sight. He begins flipping through the pages. A blur of dragons...
8844,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill. Bone Knapper. Whispering Death. Burns its victims. Buries its victims. Chokes its victims. Turns its victims inside-out. Extremely dangerous. Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight. Kill on sight. Kill on sight... Hiccup finally lands upon the page he's been looking for.
8845,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Night Fury. It's BLANK -- no image, save for a few, sparse details."
8846,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Speed unknown. Size unknown. The unholy offspring of lightning and death itself.
8847,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Never engage this dragon. Your only chance, hide and pray it does not find you. Hiccup pulls his sketchbook out of his vest and opens it to his drawing of Toothless. He lays it over the book's blank page and considers it. CLOSE ON the drawing of Toothless..."
8848,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"I can almost smell them. They're close. Steady. Stoick raises his gaze to... AN EPIC FOG BANK, towering from sky to sea like a bruised, daunting curtain, beyond which nothing is visible. The three ships drift alongside it, skirting its solid edge, looking for an opening. ON DECK the crewmen mill nervously, all too aware of what Stoick is considering."
8849,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Take us in. The helmsman steers Stoick's ship into the fog. The men draw their weapons, prepping for the worst."
8850,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"You know, I just happened to notice the book had nothing on Night Furies. Is there another book? Or a sequel? Maybe a little Night Fury pamphlet? KABLAM! A blast takes the axe head off of Hiccup's hilt, leaving a smoking hole behind him. Hiccup YELPS and RUNS."
8851,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Hey, so how would one sneak up on a Night Fury?"
8852,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"I know, I know, but hypothetically..."
8853,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"They probably take the daytime off. You know, like a cat. Has anyone ever seen one napping?"
8854,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Just... let me... why don't you... The Nadder spins around and races back toward them like a Raptor. Astrid untangles herself and tries to pull her axe from Hiccup's shield... which is attached to his limp, gangly arm. She PLANTS her foot on his torso and YANKS the axe free, still burrowed into the shield."
8855,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Huh. Toothless. I could've sworn you had... A set of razor sharp teeth emerge from its gums to grab the fish. Toothless snatches and gnashes it up, swallowing it."
8856,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,... teeth. The teeth retract again. Toothless presses closer with an expectant look. Hiccup retreats nervously.
8857,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Uh, no. No, I don't have any more. The Fury backs Hiccup against a rock, placing himself the same position as before. The dragon closes in over him, staring blankly. A tense moment passes... then Toothless regurgitates a chunk of fish onto Hiccup's lap. They exchange stares. Hiccup realizes what Toothless wants him to do. Hiccup crouches slowly and squeamishly picks it up. The dragon waits expectantly. Hiccup gags and gnaws off a bite of the slimy fish. He forces a smile. Toothless mimics him. Amazed, Hiccup sits up and tries to touch him. Toothless HISSES and flaps off to a crash on the other side of the cove. He BLASTS the mossy ground to a red-hot temperature... and curls up on it like a giant dog. He turns to find Hiccup seated beside him. Toothless tolerates his persistent presence... until Hiccup tries to touch his damaged tail. Toothless SNAPS at him. Hiccup takes the hint and leaves."
8858,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Hey Toothless. I brought breakfast. I hope you're hungry. Hiccup drops the basket and kicks it over. Fish spill out.
8859,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Okay, that's disgusting. Toothless approaches, settling in to devour the feast."
8860,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Uh..we've got some salmon... Toothless swallows it.
8861,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,... some nice Icelandic cod... Swallows those too.
8862,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"... and a whole smoked eel. Toothless nabs it, chews a few times, then spits it out. He shakes his head violently, snorts and scrubs his massive tongue on the sand. Hiccup takes note."
8863,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"No, no, no! It's okay. Yeah, I don't like eel much either. Toothless focuses on the remainder. With the dragon distracted, Hiccup unwraps his prosthetic fin and opens it like a fan."
8864,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Okay. That's it. That's it, just stick with good stuff. And don't you mind me. I'll just be back...here. Minding my own business. Hiccup cautiously approaches the injured tail, but every time he gets near it, Toothless sweeps it away like a cat."
8865,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"It's okay. Hiccup drops a knee on top of the tail. Toothless' head juts up, slows its chewing to a halt."
8866,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Okay...okay.. The dragon tenses, slowly spreading his wings. Hiccup straps the prosthetic fin in place. He cinches the straps."
8867,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Woah! No! No! No! Hiccup struggles to hold on to the tail. As the ground speeds away, Toothless immediately TIPS into a uncontrolled bank and dive. Hiccup sees the folded fin rattling uselessly in opposition to its flared counterpart. Flap as he may, Toothless can't correct his trajectory."
8868,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,It's working! Toothless arcs just short of the water and climbs... high into the air.
8869,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Yes! Yes, I did it. He glances back at Hiccup, busily holding the tail open while trying to hold on. They're going to crash. Whoomp! Hiccup is suddenly thrown from the tail in the intense force of a turn."
8870,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Yeah!
8871,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Look out! A Zippleback head emerges out of the smoke. Fishlegs hurls his water at it, completely dousing the head. It leers and opens its mouth, spewing gas into the area."
8872,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Oh, come on!"
8873,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"BACK! BACK! BACK! Now don't you make me tell you again! The Zippleback retreats through its door and into its cave, hissing."
8874,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Yes, that's right. Back into your cage. Hiccup slyly OPENS his vest, revealing the spotted smoked EEL from earlier. He TOSSES it inside the door, then SLAMS it shut."
8875,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Now think about what you've done. Hiccup turns to the teens and Gobber. They stare, slack-jawed"
8876,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Okay! So are we done? Because I've got some things I need to... Hiccup jogs out of the ring, past the speechless group."
8877,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Yep...see you tomorrow. Astrid SNEERS. Something's going on.
8878,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Hey!
8879,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Yeah! Whoa!
8880,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,I left my axe back in the ring. He turns and hurries back.
8881,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"You guys go on ahead and I'll catch up with you. Astrid watches, suspicious."
8882,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Oh, great."
8883,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Astrid. Hey! Hi Astrid. Hi Astrid. Hi Astrid.
8884,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Not even close.
8885,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,I hope you had a little more success than me.
8886,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,He's... gone?
8887,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Hiccup?
8888,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Okay there bud, we're gonna take this nice and slow. Hiccup checks a leather cheat sheet, clipped onto his harness. Inscribed upon it are several tail positions and their pedal position equivalents."
8889,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Here we go. Here we go...position three, no four. He presses the pedal, causing the tail to flare. They roll off into an arcing bank, gloriously lit by the late afternoon sun. Hiccup tucks tight against his neck, thrilled that his new harness and vest are holding. The foot controls make the tail appendage quick and responsive. He watches Toothless' every fluctuation, trying to match it with the prosthetic. Hiccup sizes up a target -- a towering arch of stone, rising from the sea."
8890,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Alright, it's go time. It's go time. They dive toward it, lining up to pass through the arch."
8891,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Come on. Come on buddy. Come on buddy! They zip through the arch. A perfect maneuver.
8892,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Yeah! Yes, it worked! The triumph is short-lived. They smack into one of several sea stacks as Hiccup tries to keep up with the turns."
8893,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Sorry. They hurtle into another rock pillar. Toothless grumbles.
8894,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,My fault. Toothless swats him with his 'ear' plate.
8895,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. (referring to the cheat"
8896,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Yeah! Go baby! Yes! Oh, this is amazing! The wind in my... He spots the leather guide tearing free in the turbulence."
8897,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,No!
8898,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Oh gods! Oh no! Without Hiccup, the tail loses control. Hiccup and Toothless spiral downward. Toothless FIGHTS to get back under Hiccup."
8899,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Alright, okay. You just gotta kinda angle yourself. No, no...come back down towards me. Come back down-- Hiccup extends his arms and legs, giving himself as much surface area as he can. He angles back towards Toothless as the tumbling dragon WHACKS Hiccup with his wing. After a few more misses, Hiccup finally GRABS HOLD of the harness and manages to lock in -- just in time to pull Toothless out of his dive... barely shy of the tree tops. They careen past the wooded cliff and directly into a treacherous slalom course of jutting sea stacks. Hiccup pulls the cheat sheet from his teeth and attempts to check positions. It flaps violently in the turbulence, making it impossible. With no time to think, Hiccup throws it away and steers Toothless' tail on instinct... with perfect intuition. Together, they manage a tight, hair-rasing series of split- second turns, making it to the open water, unscathed. Hiccup takes a breath and glances back at the death-defying obstacle course, now safely behind them. He beams, relieved. He sits back and throws his arms up in victory."
8900,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Ah, come on."
8901,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Uh..no thanks. (gesturing to his fish on
8902,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Not so fireproof on the inside, are you? Hiccup throws the hapless Terror his freshly cooked fish."
8903,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Here you go. The appreciative little dragon gulps down the meal and approaches Hiccup cautiously. He curls up next to him. Hiccup is amazed.
8904,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Dad! You're back! He skirts the bench, blocking Stoick's view of Toothless, the prosthetic fin, and other drawings."
8905,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Gobber's not here, so... He strikes an awkwardly casual pose, trying to cover up as much as possible."
8906,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,I know. I came looking for you.
8907,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,I...have?
8908,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Just how long did you think you could hide it from me?
8909,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Nothing happens on this island without me hearing about it.
8910,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Oh?
8911,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,So.
8912,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Oh gods. Dad I'm so sorry. I was going to tell you. I just didn't know how to-- Stoick starts laughing. Big, booming. Hiccup stares, baffled."
8913,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,You're not...upset?
8914,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,What?! I was hoping for this!
8915,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Uh...you were?
8916,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"And believe me, it only gets better! Just wait til you spill a Nadder's guts for the first time. Hiccup's elated expression sinks."
8917,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"And mount your first Gronckle head on a spear. What a feeling! Stoick laughs and smacks Hiccup on the shoulder, sending him into the wall."
8918,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"You really had me going there, son. All those years of the worst Viking Berk has ever seen! Odin, it was rough. I almost gave up on you! Hiccup gets back up, grimacing in the irony of it all."
8919,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"And all the while, you were holding out on me! Thor almighty! Stoick grabs a stool and sits. His massive frame nearly fills the tiny room."
8920,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Oh, I... brought you something. He presents a horned helmet."
8921,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,To keep you safe in the ring.
8922,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Your mother would've wanted you to have it.
8923,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Matching set. Keeps her close, y'know? Hiccup eyes the mismatched helmets, grimacing."
8924,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Wear it proudly. You deserve it. You've held up your end of the deal. Stoick beams with pride. Hiccup squirms. He forces a YAWN.
8925,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,I should really get to bed.
8926,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Well..uh..good night. Stoick leaves the room awkwardly, leaving Hiccup looking more burdened than ever."
8927,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Please, by all means. She darts off, CLOSING FAST on the dragon. The crowd above cheers her on."
8928,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Wait! Wait!
8929,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"So, later. Gobber snags Hiccup as he attempts to leave."
8930,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,I'm kinda late for--
8931,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Okay quiet down. The elder has decided. Thrilled, Gobber stands behind Hiccup and Astrid. He points to Astrid as the crowd waits in silent anticipation. Gothi shakes her head 'no.' The crowd 'Oooohs.' Gobber then points to Hiccup. The elder nods an affirmative 'yes.' The crowd erupts in cheers. Astrid turns a seething, deadly glare on Hiccup."
8932,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Ha, ha! That's my boy! Hiccup is hoisted onto the recruits' shoulders and carried out to the cheering spectators..."
8933,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"... leaving. We're leaving. Let's pack up. Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation, forever. Toothless is nowhere in sight. Hiccup sets down his basket and opens it up, his head clouded with troubles."
8934,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Oh..man... SHINK! Hiccup looks up to the sound of... ASTRID, sitting on the rock right in front of him, sharpening her axe."
8935,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Uh...training? She grabs him by his odd-looking harness.
8936,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"I know this looks really bad, but you see...this is, uh... They hear a RUSTLE coming from the other side of the cove. Astrid DROPS Hiccup to the ground and sets off to investigate."
8937,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,AAAAUUGGGHHH! Why would you do that?!
8938,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,No!
8939,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"No. It's okay! It's okay... Toothless pulls up short and lands hard, SPRAYING Astrid with sand."
8940,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"We're dead. Satisfied with Astrid's departure, Toothless turns away."
8941,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,You have to give me a chance to explain.
8942,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Then I won't speak. Just let me show you. Hiccup extends a hand.
8943,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Please, Astrid. She eyes him and the dragon, then the ground far, far below. After a moment, she swats Hiccup's outstretched hand away and reluctantly climbs over the pedal, lines, and harness. She settles behind Hiccup, avoiding as much contact as possible."
8944,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Toothless? Down. Gently. Toothless leers mischievously. He spreads his wings slowly. With a WHOP, they fill with the updraft. Toothless releases the tree, tucks in his legs, and HOVERS in place."
8945,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"See? Nothing to be afraid of. Toothless suddenly LAUNCHES straight upward. Astrid SCREAMS. The acceleration is tremendous. Every downbeat bucks the saddle, heaving them into the sky, doubling their speed like a rocket. Astrid is thrown backward. She SCREAMS and hugs Hiccup for dear life, squeezing the breath out of him."
8946,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Toothless! What is wrong with you?! Bad dragon! He's not usually like this. Oh no...
8947,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Toothless, what are you doing?! We need her to like us! Toothless rockets skyward and begins tumbling head over tail."
8948,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,And now the spinning. Thank you for nothing you useless reptile. Astrid clamps her hand over her eyes.
8949,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Don't remind me. A strange, unearthly din approaches. Toothless' ear plates suddenly stand on end. Panicked, he abruptly dives, dipping into cloud cover."
8950,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Toothless! What's happening? What is it? Toothless BARKS at him. 'Quiet!' Suddenly, out of the dense cloud, a Monstrous Nightmare emerges."
8951,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Get down! Hiccup and Astrid duck. The Nightmare calls out. A Zippleback appears to the other side of Toothless, boxing him in."
8952,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,I don't know.
8953,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"What my dad wouldn't give to find this. Toothless peels away from the procession, landing on a small shadowy shelf to keep a low-profile. Hiccup and Astrid peek around, taking in the busy hive of sorts. They watch as the food continues to be dropped into the pit."
8954,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,It's satisfying to know that all of our food has been dumped down a hole.
8955,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Alright buddy, we gotta get out of here. Now! Toothless takes flight, barely evading the monster's snapping jaws. The behemoth dragon lunges for them, snatching a Zippleback out of the air instead. Toothless disappears into the winged exodus as thousands of dragons flee the caldera in fear."
8956,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"No, no! Not yet. They'll... kill Toothless."
8957,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Astrid, we have to think this through carefully. Astrid eyes him, incredulous."
8958,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Yes. Astrid's taken aback.
8959,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Just give me until tomorrow. I'll figure something out.
8960,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,What are you looking at?
8961,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Well, I can show my face in public again."
8962,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"... or more proud than I am. Today, my boy becomes a Viking. TODAY, HE"
8963,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,It's not the dragon I'm worried about.
8964,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Put an end to this. She eyes him, dubious."
8965,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,I have to try.
8966,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"I'm ready. The door bolt is raised. The crowd grows quiet... Beat. BOOM! The doors blast open with a stream of sticky fire. Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, coated in flames. It tears out of its cave like an irate bull -- as the crowd roars and jeers. It climbs the walls and chain enclosure like a bat, hissing at the provoking crowd and blasting fire."
8967,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"What is he doing? The dragon presses closer, snorting. Hiccup extends his open hand. It snarls."
8968,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"I'm not one of them. GASPS and MURMURS race through the crowd. ON STOICK, as all eyes turn to him. He's welling with upset. Hiccup avoids Stoick's glare and remains focused on the Nightmare, holding his hand out. It paces around him, calming down."
8969,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Stop the fight.
8970,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,No. I need you all to see this. The crowd gets restless.
8971,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,They're not what we think they are. We don't have to kill them.
8972,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Out of my way!
8973,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"This way! Astrid makes it through, but the Nightmare BLASTS the doorway, cutting Hiccup off. It pounces on him and prepares to finish him off. Suddenly, a terrible roar pierces the din."
8974,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Go! GO!
8975,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Dad! No! He won't hurt you! The other Vikings surround and attack Toothless. He tosses them aside like rag dolls, his eyes focused on Stoick."
8976,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"No, don't! You're only making it worse! Stoick raises his hammer as he charges for Toothless. Toothless ducks and pounces on him. They tumble end over end."
8977,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Toothless! STOP! He pins Stoick and inhales. The familiar hiss of gas builds. Everyone braces...
8978,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Put it with the others! His burning glare turn to Hiccup.
8979,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,I should have known. I should have seen the signs.
8980,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Dad.
8981,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"We had a deal! Stoick pauses to say something, but stops short. He SNORTS and resumes pacing, repeating the cycle."
8982,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"So everything in the ring. A trick? A lie? He stomps toward Hiccup. Stops short and points, fighting back words."
8983,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"I screwed up. I should have told you before now. Take this out on me, be mad at me, but please... just don't hurt Toothless."
8984,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,The dragon? That's what you're worried about? Not the people you almost killed?!
8985,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,He was just protecting me! He's not dangerous.
8986,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,They've killed HUNDREDS OF US!
8987,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"And we've killed THOUSANDS OF THEM! They defend themselves, that's all! They raid us because they have to! If they don't bring enough food back, they'll be eaten themselves."
8988,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,--Their island? He stomps back... pointing an accusing finger.
8989,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,So you've been to the nest.
8990,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Did I say nest? Hiccup goes silent -- he said too much.
8991,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,How did you find it?!
8992,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"No... I didn't. Toothless did. Only a dragon can find the island. Stoick GLARES. A moment passes, then an idea takes form on his face. His eyes flare. Hiccup watches, realizing. Stoick stomps toward the doorway."
8993,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Oh no. No, Dad. No. Hiccup chases after him, panicked."
8994,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Dad. It's not what you think. You don't know what you're up against. It's like nothing you've ever seen. He grabs Stoick by the arm, tugging with all his might. He has no effect whatsoever."
8995,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Dad. Please. I promise you that you can't win this one. Nothing.
8996,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"No. Dad. No. For once in your life,"
8997,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,You've thrown your lot in with them. You're not a Viking.
8998,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Set sail! We head for Helheim's Gate. He then notices HICCUP watching from his familiar cliff-side perch beyond the village. Their eyes meet, full of hurt and regret. Hiccup slowly shakes his head in warning. Stoick breaks the stare and turns to Toothless, fuming."
8999,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Lead us home, Devil."
9000,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Thank you for summing that up.
9001,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Why couldn't I have killed that dragon when I found him in the woods. It would have been better for everyone.
9002,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,I don't know. I couldn't.
9003,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Oh for the love of -- I was a coward! I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.
9004,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Probably something stupid.
9005,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Then something crazy. Astrid smiles.
9006,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Sound your positions. Stay within earshot. Shouts pour in from all directions.
9007,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Find the nest and take it.
9008,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Shhh. Stoick notices that Toothless' ear plates are at the alert, quietly reacting to inaudible sounds. Stoick crosses to the stern of the ship and grabs the tiller, moving the helmsman out of the way."
9009,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Step aside. Stoick pulls the ship into a turn, covertly following Toothless' head movements."
9010,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Uh...
9011,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,I didn't...
9012,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Stay low and ready your weapons. Stoick's ship suddenly JERKS to a halt as the keel burrows into shallow black sand. Stoick hops overboard, landing on a sprawling beach. The BUZZING suddenly STOPS. Above him, a craggy volcano towers into the gloom."
9013,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"We're here. Behind him, several dragon-headed bows pierce the fog."
9014,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Relax. It's okay... it's okay.
9015,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"You're going to need something to help you hold on. The teens eye each other apprehensively, and look up to reveal... ALL THE DRAGONS standing in the ring, facing the teens expectantly."
9016,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"When we crack this mountain open, all hell is going to break loose."
9017,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"No matter how this ends, it ends today. He walks toward the base of the volcano wall, back by several hundred warriors. He raises his arm and drops it."
9018,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"In a chaotic flurry, the dragons suddenly rush out like bats from a cave. The take to the air, bypassing the axe-swinging Vikings and fleeing the island in a mass exodus. The battle-ready Vikings drop their weapons, confused."
9019,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,This isn't over. Form your ranks! Hold together! The men SCRAMBLE to organize themselves.
9020,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Get clear!
9021,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,No! NO! The Red Death BLASTS the ships like a mile-long flamethrower. The sails are torched. Vikings dive overboard and masts come down. Gobber Joins Stoick.
9022,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Lead the men to the far side of the island.
9023,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Gobber, go with the men."
9024,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"No, me! The Red Death remains focused on Stoick - this is it. It rears back and inhales. Gas begins to amass, when... KABLAM! A BLAST explodes against the back of The Red Death's head. It turns distracted, as... ... a Nadder punches through the flames, banking across the sky. Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, a Zippleback, and a Gronckle. They roll in unison, revealing the recruits riding on their backs. Hiccup leads, with Astrid clinging to his waist. GOBBER AND STOICK, watch slack-jawed, in awe."
9025,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Ruff, Tuff, watch your backs! Move Fishlegs! The monster shakes off the blast and snaps in their wake. Hiccup directs his squadron out of harm's way. They climb out of reach and circle each other."
9026,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Up, let's move it! The dragons climb past the Red Death."
9027,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Fishlegs, break it down."
9028,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Okay. Lout, Legs, hang in its blind spot. Make some noise, keep it confused. Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has a shot limit. Make it mad."
9029,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"There! He steers the Nadder over the deck and hands Astrid the reins. He lines up his jump... and hops off, guarding his face from the flames. He lands on the burning deck."
9030,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Okay, hold on. Hold on. He gets to work on the chains."
9031,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Working at the chains. He can't budge them. Fire licks at his clothes. He looks up to see...
9032,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"You got it, bud. Hiccup climbs onto Toothless and buckles himself in. Stoick grabs his arm."
9033,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Hiccup. I'm sorry...for everything.
9034,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Yeah...me too.
9035,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,You don't have to go up there.
9036,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard. They exchange smiles.
9037,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"I'm proud to call you my son. Hiccup beams, taken aback."
9038,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Thanks dad. Stoick lets go of Hiccup's arm. Hiccup spurs Toothless on, charged with his father's belief in him. They rocket into the sky as Stoick watches."
9039,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Did you get her? Toothless grunts.
9040,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Do you think that did it? Suddenly, the enraged behemoth RISES into frame... flapping its wings furiously. A daunting sight."
9041,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Well, he can fly. Hiccup and Toothless DIVE into the tangled sea stacks - they weave through the rock like rabbits through a briar. The Red Death SNAPS at them, but cannot reach them. Hiccup and Toothless PULL AHEAD. The Red Death SMASHES through the canopy of rock and pulls in behind Toothless. He BURSTS THROUGH fifty-foot formations like they were saplings."
9042,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Okay Toothless, time to disappear. Toothless PULLS into a steep climb, heading toward the clouds."
9043,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Come on bud! The Red Death follows, closing in fast."
9044,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Here it comes! BLAST! They narrowly dodge a column of flame and smoke. They reach the low-hanging clouds and pierce them. The monster follows, immediately losing them in the hampered visibility. It roars irritably. From out of nowhere, Toothless DIVES at the huge dragon, BLASTING and PUNCTURING a hole in its wing. Toothless and Hiccup are gone again before the dragon can get a shot at them."
9045,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Watch out! The random blast CLIPS Toothless' tail. It's heavily damaged.
9046,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Okay, time's up. Let's see if this works. He pulls Toothless into a turn. They fly directly into the Red Death's face, taunting it."
9047,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Come on! Is that the best you can do!? Toothless utters an insult too, and they jackknife into a steep dive. The Red Death pursues. Toothless PUMPS his wings, racing faster than he's ever gone before. Hiccup and Toothless stay just ahead of the Red Death -- no longer trying to evade it. Hiccup glances back to check the tail - it's disintegrating."
9048,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,Stay with me buddy. We're good. Just a little bit longer. The Red Death closes the gap. Hiccup tucks in and holds Toothless steady -- allowing the monster to set its sights on them. It narrows its eyes.
9049,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Hold, Toothless. The Red Death OPENS his mouth. The familiar gas HISS emanates from his throat -- ignition is coming."
9050,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"No. No. Hiccup and Toothless can't maneuver - they're dead in the air. The giant club tail CLIPS Toothless, TEARING Hiccup from the harness and sending him tumbling against the backdrop of the fast-approaching fireball. Toothless STRUGGLES with all his might to reach the unconscious Hiccup. But the fireball swallows them both."
9051,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Hiccup? Hiccup!? Stoick appears, searching desperately. Everything is scorched. Even the ground is smoking from the terrible heat."
9052,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Hiccup!? Son!? Through the ash, Stoick the motionless silhouette of Toothless."
9053,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"Oh son...I did this... Astrid pushes through the crowd, her eyes welling up. Followed by Gobber. They flank Stoick as he kneels, slumped over. Behind them, a ring of Vikings form, keeping a respectful distance. As the dust and smoke clear, a ring of wild dragons can also be seen, gathering just behind and between the Vikings. Toothless stirs and groggily rolls his head toward Stoick. Their eyes meet."
9054,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"I'm so sorry... Toothless unfolds his wings, revealing Hiccup, unconscious, clutched safely against his chest. Stoick's eyes widen."
9055,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,Hiccup. He scoops Hiccup into his arms. Listens to his heart. Bursts into relieved laughter.
9056,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,He's alive!
9057,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Okay, okay! I'm happy to see you too, bud. Now just-- Toothless steps on his groin, causing Hiccup to sit BOLT UPRIGHT with a YELP. He looks around, confounded. He's in his bed, moved beside the fire pit on the main floor of his house."
9058,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"I'm in my house. You're in my house. Toothless TEARS around the room, knocking things over, far too big for the space."
9059,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Uh...does my dad know you're in here?! Toothless pauses at the foot of the bed, tongue wagging. He eyes the rafters... and LEAPS UP onto them, brimming with 'happy dog' energy."
9060,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Okay...okay... ... but STUMBLES with the first step. Toothless catches Hiccup's fall with his head... and slowly lifts him up, stabilizing him."
9061,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Thanks bud. Hiccup leans on him like a crutch. They take a few steps together. Their missing parts form a poetic silhouette as they make their way toward the door. Hiccup pries it open , revealing a MONSTROUS NIGHTMARE flapping outside the door. Hiccup YELPS and slams the door closed. He turns to Toothless, alarmed."
9062,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Toothless? Stay here, bud. Hiccup pauses... and cracks the door open again. He peeks outside, his eyes widening. He allows to door to swing open, revealing... ... the Monstrous Nightmare, carrying Snotlout on its back."
9063,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,I knew it. I'm dead. Stoick laughs.
9064,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"No, but you gave it your best shot. He puts his arm around Hiccup, steadying him. He gestures to the transformed village."
9065,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,STOICK,"So? What do you think? Hiccup just shrugs, amazed. Below, the plaza, villagers take notice."
9066,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"(bittersweet, coming to"
9067,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"... could get used to it. Gobber presents Hiccup with a rebuilt saddle, rigging, and tail."
9068,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,This... is Berk.
9069,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"Any food that grows here is tough and tasteless. The people that grow here are even more so. Hiccup and Astrid race their dragons through the village -- under eaves, over rooftops, down cliff-sides, and between ship masts. It's a high energy, romantic dance of sorts."
9070,How-to-Train-Your-Dragon,HICCUP,"The only upsides are the pets. While other places have...ponies or parrots, we have... Their fellow recruits join them as they take to the open sky, rocketing far above the village. The Northern sky swirls with blazing, multicolored dragons. Hiccup and Toothless break from the pack, spinning into the blinding sun."
9071,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Shhhl
9072,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,It's the Cross of Coronadol Cortes gave it to him in 15201
9073,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,That Cross is an important artifact. It belongs in a museum.

9076,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,It's only a snake.
9077,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Did you hear what I said?
9078,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I don't know... I'll think of something.

9085,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,It belongs to Coronado.
9086,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,This should be in a museum.
9087,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Magic?

9103,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Well, yes, sir. It's right here!"
9104,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Too small for two of us.

9108,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Seventy percent of all archaeology is done in the library. Research. Reading.

9112,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,You know how long I've been looking for that?!
9113,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,All my life!
9114,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,We can discuss my honorarium over dinner and champagne tonight.

9117,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Okay. Irene, put everyone's name on a list, in the order they arrived, and I'll see each and every one of them in turn."

9119,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
9120,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid- Twelfth Century, I should think."

9125,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
9126,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,An old man's dream.
9127,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Grail lore is his hobby. He's a teacher of Medieval Literature. The one the students hope they don't get.
9128,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing."
9129,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to ato a Franciscan friar, I think."
9130,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
9131,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Yes?
9132,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?"
9133,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Dad? He's an academic A bookworm. He's not a field mans
9134,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Dad? Dad?
9135,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!"
9136,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Dad?
9137,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Mail! That's it, Marcus!"
9138,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Venice, Italy!"
9139,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
9140,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Do you believe, Marcus?"
9141,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
9142,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now."
9143,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Ah, Venice..."
9144,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.
9145,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,Doctor Jones?
9146,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Yes?
9147,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,I knew it was you
9148,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,you have your father's eyes.
9149,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
9150,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
9151,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,Marcus Brody?
9152,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,Doctor Elsa Schneider.
9153,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
9154,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!"
9155,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Frauleinwill you permit me?
9156,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,I usually don't.
9157,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I usually don't either.
9158,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,"In that case, I permit you."
9159,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,It would make me very happy.
9160,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,But I'm already sadby tomorrow it will have faded.
9161,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
9162,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,Yes. I have something to show you.
9163,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,I left your father working in the library. He sent me to the map section to fetch an ancient plan of the city. When I got back to his tablehe'd gonewith all his papersexcept for that scrap which I found near his chair.
9164,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Roman numerals.
9165,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,Here is the library.
9166,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,That doesn't look much like a library.
9167,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,In this case it's the literal truth. We're on holy ground. These columns over here...
9168,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,... were brought back as spoils of war after the sacking of Byzantium during the Crusades.
9169,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,Now please excuse me. The library's closing in a few moments. I'll arrange for us to stay a little longer.
9170,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,MarcusI've seen this window before.
9171,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Right here. In Dad's Diary. You see?
9172,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Dad was onto something here!
9173,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves."
9174,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,Find something?
9175,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,"My God, I must be blind"
9176,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Dad wasn't looking for a book about the Knight's Tomb... he was looking for the Tomb itself
9177,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Don't you get it? The Tomb is somewhere in the library! You said yourself it used to be a church! Look.
9178,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Three.
9179,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Three!
9180,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Seven.
9181,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Seven... Ten.
9182,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,And ten. Now where's the ten? Look around for the ten.
9183,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Three, seven and ten."
9184,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Ten. ""X"" marks the spot."
9185,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Bingo.
9186,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,"You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father."
9187,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Except he's lost, and I'm not."
9188,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,Lower me down.
9189,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Look after this for me, will you?"
9190,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Come on.
9191,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
9192,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
9193,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
9194,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"That's right. If there's a Knight of the First Crusade entombed down here, that's where we'll find him."
9195,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,What's this one?
9196,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,The Ark of the Covenant.
9197,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,Are you sure?
9198,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Pretty sure.
9199,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Watch out.
9200,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Petroleum. I could sink a well down here and retire.
9201,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Give me the lighter.
9202,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Oh, rats..."
9203,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Come onl
9204,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Come here.
9205,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Look. . .
9206,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,It must be one of these...
9207,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
9208,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,It's this one.
9209,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,This is itl we found it! Look the engraving on the Shield. It's the same as on the Grail Tablets The Shield is the Second Marker!
9210,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,What's that?
9211,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
9212,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,Just like your fathergiddy as a schoolboy.
9213,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
9214,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
9215,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Get back! Back against the wall.
9216,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Quick! Under it!
9217,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Air pocket!
9218,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Don't wander off.
9219,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,What?
9220,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,What?
9221,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I think I've found a way out. Deep breath.
9222,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Ah, Venicel"
9223,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Are you crazy?! You don't go between them!
9224,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,Go between them? Are you crazy?!
9225,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I said go around!
9226,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,You said go between them!
9227,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I said don't go between them!
9228,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,No!!
9229,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Why are you trying to kill us?
9230,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
9231,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Where is he? Talkor you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!"
9232,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Then we'll die.
9233,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,This is your last chance.
9234,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,All right! Where's my father
9235,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Who are you?
9236,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,And why were you trying to kill me?
9237,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
9238,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,How's the head?
9239,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,The Knights of the First Crusade laid siege to the city of Alexandretta for over a year. The entire city was destroyed.
9240,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus you remember what the Grail Tablet said. ""Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."" But where exactly?"
9241,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Alexandretta. Now we know.
9242,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun."
9243,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I'm going after Dad.
9244,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Elsa?
9245,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Elsa?
9246,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Elsa?
9247,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Elsa?
9248,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,My room!
9249,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Mine, too."
9250,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,What were they looking for?
9251,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,This.
9252,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,The Grail Diary.
9253,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Uh-huh.
9254,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,You had it? You didn't trust me!
9255,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I didn't know you.
9256,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,At least I let you tag along.
9257,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,"Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere."
9258,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Knock it off. You're not mad.
9259,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,No?
9260,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,No. You like the way I do things.
9261,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
9262,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Look, what do you think is going on here? Since I've met you, I've nearly been incinerated, drowned, shot at, and chopped into fish bait. We're caught in the middle of something sinister here. My guess is Dad found out more than he was looking for. And until I'm sure, I'm going to continue to do things the way I think they should be done."
9263,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,How dare you kiss me!
9264,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Leave me alone. I don't like fast women.
9265,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,And I hate arrogant men.
9266,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Ahh, Venice."
9267,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,What do you know about this place?
9268,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
9269,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,What are you going to do?
9270,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Don't know. Think of something.
9271,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,And not before time! Did you intend to leave us standing on the doorstep all day? We're drenched!
9272,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Now look! I've gone and caught a sniffle.
9273,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries."
9274,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?"
9275,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,How dare he?!
9276,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Nazis. I hate these guys.
9277,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,This one. I think he's in here.
9278,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,How do you know?
9279,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Because it's wired.
9280,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,Indy? Indy?
9281,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Don't worry... this is kid's play. I'll be right back.
9282,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Junior?
9283,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Yes, sirl"
9284,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,It is you Junior!
9285,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Don't call me that, please."
9286,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,But what are you doing here?
9287,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I came to get you! What do you think?
9288,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Late Fourteenth Century, Ming Dynasty."
9289,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Oh, it breaks the heart."
9290,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"And the head. You hit me, Dad!"
9291,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,I'll never forgive myself
9292,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Don't worryI'm fine.
9293,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Thank God!
9294,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"... it's fake. See, you can tell by the cross section."
9295,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here."
9296,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them."
9297,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Dad, they come in through the doors."
9298,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Good point.
9299,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,But better safe than sorry.
9300,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Humpfso I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it."
9301,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
9302,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Through the library?
9303,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Right.
9304,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
9305,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Found it.
9306,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,He was actually there? You saw him?
9307,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Well, what was left of him."
9308,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
9309,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Alexandretta.
9310,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior..."
9311,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,... you did it.
9312,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"No, Dad. You did. Forty years."
9313,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,If only I could have been with you.
9314,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"There were rats, Dad."
9315,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Rats?
9316,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Yeah. big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
9317,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,They want my diary.
9318,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Yeah?
9319,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,I knew I had to get that book as far away from me as I possibly could.
9320,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Yeah. . .
9321,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,You doltl Do you think that my son would be that stupid that he would bring my Diary all the way back here?
9322,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"You didn't, did you? You didn't bring it, did you?"
9323,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Well, uh..."
9324,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,You did!!
9325,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Look, can we discuss this later?"
9326,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
9327,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Will you take it easy....!
9328,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place? So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
9329,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I came here to save you.
9330,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??"
9331,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I told you--
9332,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,--don't call me Junior!
9333,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Look what you did!!
9334,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,I can't believe what you just....
9335,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Elsa? Elsa?
9336,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,But she's one of them!
9337,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,"Indy, please!"
9338,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,She's a Nazi!
9339,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,What?!
9340,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Trust me!
9341,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,"Indy, no!"
9342,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Oh yeah? Go ahead!
9343,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,No! Don't Shoot!
9344,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Don't worry. He won't.
9345,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,"Indy, please! Do what he says!"
9346,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,And don't listen to her!
9347,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Wait! Waitl
9348,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,I'm sorry.
9349,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"No, don't be."
9350,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,But you should have listened to your father.
9351,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
9352,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Umh?
9353,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,How did you she was a Nazi?
9354,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,She talks in her sleep.
9355,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,I didn't trust her. Why did you?
9356,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Donovan
9357,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,I misjudged you WalterI knew you'd sell your mother for an Etruscan vase. But I didn't know you'd sell your country and your soul to the slime of humanity.
9358,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,This book contained a mapa map with no namesprecise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
9359,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,So it did.
9360,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,You're wasting your breath. He won't tell us. And he doesn't have to... it's perfectly obvious where the pages are... ... he's given them to Marcus Brody.
9361,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Marcus?! You didn't drag poor Marcus along, did you? He's not up to the challenge."
9362,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"The hell you will. He's got a two-day head-start on you, which is more than he needs. Brody's got friends in every town and village from here to the Sudan. He speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom. He'll blend in. Disappear. You'll never see him again. With any luck, he's got the Grail already."
9363,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Intolerable.
9364,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,So?
9365,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,"Thank you, Herr Oberst. I will meet you at Iskenderun."
9366,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,"No. If we fail to recover the pages from Brody, we'll need them alive."
9367,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,"Don't look at me like thatwe both wanted the Grail, I would have done anything to get it. You would have done the same."
9368,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I'm sorry you think so.
9369,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,I can't forget... how wonderful it was.
9370,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Thank you. It was rather wonderful.
9371,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,That's how Austrians say goodbye.
9372,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Ohh. . .
9373,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
9374,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,So did I.
9375,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
9376,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
9377,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Are you kidding?I made that up! You know Marcushe got lost once in his own museum!
9378,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Can you try and reach into my left jacket pocket?
9379,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,What am I looking for?
9380,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,My lucky charm.
9381,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Feels like a cigarette lighter.
9382,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Try and burn through the ropes.
9383,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Very good.
9384,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,I ought to tell you something.
9385,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Don't get sentimental now Dad save it 'til we get out of here.
9386,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,The floor's on fire! See?!
9387,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,What???
9388,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,And the chair.
9389,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"All right, movel Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do."
9390,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Dad!
9391,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,What?
9392,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Dad!
9393,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,What?
9394,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Dad!
9395,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,What?
9396,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Head for the fireplace!
9397,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Oh.
9398,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I think I can get these ropes off.
9399,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Whoopsl
9400,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Our situation has not improved.
9401,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Listen Dad... I'm almost free.
9402,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,This is intolerable!
9403,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"I'm out, Dad!"
9404,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Well done, boy!"
9405,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Come on Dad.
9406,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Dead end.
9407,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,There's got to be a... a secret door around. A passageway or something.
9408,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,I find that if I just sit down and think...
9409,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Dad!
9410,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,... the solution presents itself.
9411,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Great. More boats.
9412,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Would you say this has been just another typical day for you? Huh?
9413,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Ooofl No! It's been better than most.
9414,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Come on, Dad. Come onl"
9415,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
9416,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Ha!
9417,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Stop!
9418,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,What?
9419,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Stop! Stop!
9420,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
9421,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Brody's this way.
9422,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,My Diary's in Berlin.
9423,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map."
9424,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,There is more in the Diary than just the map.
9425,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,All right Dadtell me.
9426,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge."
9427,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,What final challenge?
9428,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Three devices of such lethal cunning.
9429,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Booby traps?
9430,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm."
9431,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,But what are they? Can't you remember?
9432,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember
9433,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
9434,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
9435,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,What about Marcus?
9436,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Marcus would agree with me.
9437,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christl
9438,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?"
9439,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
9440,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her."
9441,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"My boy, we are Pilgrims in an unholy land."
9442,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Fraulein Doctor. Where is it?
9443,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,How did you get here?
9444,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Where is it? I want it.
9445,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,You came back for the book? Whv?
9446,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,My father didn't want it incinerated.
9447,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,"Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika."
9448,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands forwho gives a damn what you think?
9449,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,You do.
9450,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,All I have to do is squeeze.
9451,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,All I have to do is scream.
9452,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I've got it. Let's get the hell out of here.
9453,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,What did you get?
9454,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
9455,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Good.
9456,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Well, we made it."
9457,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment."
9458,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Relax.
9459,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Fahrscheine, bitte."
9460,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Tickets please.
9461,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Fahrscheine meine Dame. Bitte.
9462,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Fahrscheine meine Herr.
9463,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Tickets please.
9464,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,No ticket.
9465,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience."
9466,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa---er, her grandfather!"
9467,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Well, I'm as human as the next man."
9468,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I was the next man.
9469,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Ships that pass in the night...
9470,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
9471,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Hmmm... What did we talk about?
9472,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,We didn't talk. We never talked.
9473,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,And do I detect a rebuke?
9474,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that."
9475,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Actually, I was a wonderful father."
9476,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,When?
9477,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self- reliance.
9478,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
9479,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,You left just when you were becoming interesting.
9480,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Dad, how can you --?"
9481,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Very well. I'm here now.
9482,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,What do you want to talk about? Hmmm?
9483,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Well... I can't think of anything.
9484,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Then what are you complaining about? Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges. ""First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth. """
9485,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,What does that mean?
9486,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,I don't know. We'll find out.
9487,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,They're turning around. They're taking us back to Germany.
9488,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Well, I thought it would take them a lot longer to figure out the radio was dead. Come on, Dad. Move!"
9489,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Come on, Dad. Come on!"
9490,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,I didn't know you could fly a plane.
9491,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Fly--yes. Land--no.
9492,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Dad, you're gonna have to use the machine gun. Get it ready."
9493,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Eleven o'clock!
9494,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Dadeleven o'clock!!
9495,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,What happens at eleven o'clock?
9496,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Twelveeleventen. Eleven o'clock. Fire!
9497,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Dad, are we hit?!"
9498,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,More or less.
9499,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Son, I'm sorry. They got us."
9500,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Hang on, Dads We're going in!"
9501,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Nice landing.
9502,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Thanks.
9503,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Those people are trying to kill us!
9504,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"I know, Dadl"
9505,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,It's a new experience for me.
9506,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,It happens to me all the time.
9507,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,This is intolerable!
9508,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,This could be close.
9509,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Faster, boy --faster!"
9510,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Well, they don't come any closer than that!"
9511,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Dad, he's coming back."
9512,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"I suddenly remembered Charlemagne. ""Let my armies be the rocks and the trees and the birds in the sky."""
9513,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,We have no time to lose. Indiana Jones and his father have escaped.
9514,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"What happened to Marcus, Sallah?"
9515,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Now they have the map! And in this sort of race, there's no silver medal for finishing second."
9516,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Ah, I see Brody. He seems okay. They've got a tank. Six-pound gun."
9517,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
9518,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Dad, we're well out of range."
9519,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Come on--come on!
9520,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,No. It's him all right. He's here somewhere.
9521,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Now, who are all these people?"
9522,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation."
9523,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I'm going after those horses.
9524,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I don't need camels.
9525,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,No camels!
9526,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Marcus!
9527,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"""Genius of the Restoration"""
9528,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"It's a rescue, old boys Come on."
9529,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,It tells me that goose-stepping morons like yourself should try reading books instead of burning them.
9530,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?"
9531,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Where's my father?
9532,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Dad! Dad! Dad!
9533,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Junior? Junior? Junior!

9537,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,It's war.
9538,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Didn't I tell you it was a rescue, huh?"
9539,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Dad?
9540,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,You call this archaeology?
9541,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Get out of there, Dad!"
9542,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Where's Marcus?!
9543,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Dad!

9547,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"Oh, God. I've lost him. And I never told him anything. I just wasn't ready, Marcus. Five minutes would have been enough."
9548,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,"I thought I'd lost you, boy."
9549,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"I thought you had too, sir."
9550,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Wellwell done! Come on!
9551,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,HENRY,Let's go then. why are you sitting there resting when we're so near the end? Come on let's go!
9552,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,I never expected to see you again.
9553,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
9554,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
9555,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,Shooting me won't get you anywhere.

9587,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,INDY,"Listen, I don't have time to explain, but"
9588,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade,ELSA,Let me choose.

9627,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,So this is where Forrestal cashed in.
9628,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Competitor. He was good, very good."
9629,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,No one ever had what we have... partners.
9630,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Assuming that pillar there marks the corner and...

9632,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Forrestal.
9633,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Now, Satipo, we don't want to be discouraged by every little thing."
9634,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Let me see that.
9635,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Try not to touch the vines.
9636,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,That's what scares me.
9637,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,You wait here.
9638,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Adios.
9639,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Too bad they don't know you like I do, Belloq."
9640,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Get it going! Get it going!
9641,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,GO!
9642,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I can't stand snakes.
9643,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I hate them.
9644,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I don't know. Just because Belloq had it doesn't mean he kept it.
9645,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Getting it away from those Indians would be a neat trick I hope they got him.
9646,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"That's all right, Phil. Thanks a lot."
9647,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,No. I'll see you Thursday.
9648,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Hey, if you don't like them, I can always return them."
9649,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Then what's wrong?
9650,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,What kind of people?
9651,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Government?
9652,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I've already served.
9653,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,We haven't spoken in ten years. I'm afraid we had a bit of a falling out.
9654,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Just rumors. Somewhere in Asia, last I heard."
9655,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I understand.
9656,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Tanis. Ain't that somethin'!
9657,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Ah, Ravenwood's no Nazi."
9658,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,They're looking for the headpiece to the Staff of Ra.
9659,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Only half of it. Ravenwood had the other half.
9660,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,It all has to do with the Ark of the Covenant. The chest the Hebrews used to carry around the Ten Commandments.
9661,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"An Egyptian pharaoh stole the Ark from Jerusalem and took it back to the city of Tanis. A short time later, Tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm that lasted a year. But before that, the Pharaoh had had the Ark hidden away in a secret chamber called the Well of the Souls. Which is where the Staff of Ra comes in."
9662,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Now this was rather clever. The Staff was really just a big stick - oh, I don't know, say like this - no one really knows for sure. Any way, it was capped by an elaborate headpiece with a carving of the sun at the top. What you had to do was take the Staff to a special map room in Tanis - it had the whole city laid out in miniature on the floor. When you placed the Staff in a certain spot in this room, at a certain time of day, the sun would shine through a hole here in the headpiece and then send a beam of light down here - to the map - giving you the location of the Well of the Souls..."
9663,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Which is probably what the Nazis are after.
9664,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Look like? Why, it's right here..."
9665,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Yes. That's what the Hebrews thought.
9666,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Who knows... lightning... fire... the power of God.
9667,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Oh yes. The Bible tells of it leveling mountains and wasting entire regions. Moses promised that when the Ark was with you, ""your enemies will be scattered and your foes fell before you"". An army which carries the Ark before it is invincible."
9668,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Oh, there's one other thing that Hitler undoubtably believes about the Ark... It's said that the Lost Ark will be recovered at the time of the coming of the True Messiah."
9669,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Most certainly.
9670,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,This isn't really a good time.
9671,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,All right. Come on in.
9672,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I'll be in a minute.
9673,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Good work, Marcus. I had a feeling this would happen. And, of course, the Museum gets the Ark when we're done."
9674,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Okay, here's the way it's gonna be. First, I'll high-tail it to Shanghai and get the piece from General Hok. Then I think I know where I can find Ravenwood. If only I can get -"
9675,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I'll worry about that when the time comes. My only hope is to find the Well of the Souls before the Nazis do.
9676,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,What's the hurry?
9677,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Great. Got it.
9678,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I've got to get to Nepal.
9679,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Hello, Marion."
9680,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Nice to see you, too."
9681,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Take it easy. I'm looking for your father.
9682,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,What happened?
9683,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Do you find him?
9684,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Not a bad way to go. Doing what he loved.
9685,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Why not leave? Go back to the States.
9686,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Where you gonna get it?
9687,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I need one of the pieces your father collected.
9688,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I never meant to hurt you.
9689,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,You knew what you were doing.
9690,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I guess that depends on your definition.
9691,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Look, I did what I did. I don't expect you to be happy about it. But maybe we can do each other some good."
9692,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Shut up and listen for a second. I want that piece your father had. I've got money.
9693,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Enough to get you back to the States. Where are his things?
9694,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Everything?
9695,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,That's too bad.
9696,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Seltzer.
9697,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"You're a tough broad now, aren't you?"
9698,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I can only say I'm sorry so many times.
9699,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"A bronze piece, about this size. In the shape of the sun. Probably broken off at the bottom. Has a little hole in it, off-center. Does that sound familiar?"
9700,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Do you know where it is?
9701,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Three thousand. American.
9702,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Maybe.
9703,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Okay, five thousand. That's all I can give you now. I can get you more when you land in the States."
9704,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"I'm back, aren't I?"
9705,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,You can trust me.
9706,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Why?
9707,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I trust you.
9708,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I've heard that.
9709,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Bossy, aren't you?"
9710,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Tomorrow.
9711,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Hello.
9712,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Let's get out of here!
9713,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,It's here?
9714,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Forget it! I want you out of here. Now!
9715,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Let's go!
9716,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I owe you plenty!
9717,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,You're something!
9718,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"I knew the Germans would hire you, Sallah. They couldn't have an excavation in the desert without the best digger in Egypt."
9719,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Tell me about the map room at Tanis.
9720,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Those Nazis are moving awfully fast.
9721,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Belloq. So he got away from the Indians. This is going to be more interesting that I thought.
9722,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Even Belloq won't be able to find it without that. Can you make anything of those markings? They're nothing I'm familiar with.
9723,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"What is it, my friend?"
9724,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Do you really need that monkey?
9725,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,And your brains.
9726,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,He'll be OK. Come on. Come on.
9727,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Run! Get out of here!
9728,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Go, dammit! Go!"
9729,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Marion.
9730,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Too bad. I'm drinking alone.
9731,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Belloq.
9732,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I ought to kill you right now.
9733,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Not a very private place for a murder.
9734,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Try the local sewer.
9735,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Now you're getting nasty.
9736,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"What about your boss, der Fuhrer? I thought he was waiting to take possession."
9737,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"I hope your friends are patient. Dangerous work, Belloq."
9738,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Tell me, did you get away with the idol?"
9739,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"You know, if it's God you want to talk to, maybe I can arrange it."
9740,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Yes. Yes, I'll come now."
9741,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Thanks you. Marion's dead.
9742,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,And they made the calculation in the map room?
9743,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,The Well of the Souls.
9744,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Just want I need.
9745,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,How 'bout the height of the staff? Did Belloq get it off of there?
9746,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,You said their top section was blank. Are you absolutely sure?
9747,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Belloq's staff is seven and a half inches short. They're digging in the wrong spot!
9748,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,My God! They aren't kidding!
9749,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,What time does the sun hit the map?
9750,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,We haven't got much time. Where are the Germans digging for the Well of the Souls?
9751,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Okay. Let's go.
9752,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Sallah. Sallah!
9753,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Sallah!
9754,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I though you were dead.
9755,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,They must have switched baskets. Thank god for that! Bless those bastards. Have they hurt you?
9756,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I have to leave you here for a little while. I know where the Ark is. If I take you out of here they'll start combing the place for us.
9757,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Keep your voice down.
9758,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Look, you don't know how glad I am to see you. And I don't like doing this. But the whole thing will be shot if you don't just sit here quietly. They haven't hurt you in the last twenty-four hours, they aren't going to start now. I'll be back to get you in no time."
9759,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,There!
9760,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,The Ark must be in that stone case. What's that gray stuff all over the floor -
9761,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Why snakes? Why did it have to be snakes? Anything else.
9762,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Lots of torches. And oil. I want a landing strip down there.
9763,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Don't touch it! Never touch it!
9764,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Hurry up! Why did it have to be snakes?
9765,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,What the -
9766,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Why don't you fellows come down here? I'll show you.
9767,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Don't panic. There's plenty of time for that later. Wave that at anything that slithers.
9768,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Just watch the floor.
9769,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,There!
9770,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Come on!
9771,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Stay here!
9772,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I'll be back in a minute. We're going through this wall.
9773,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Just keep your eyes open and get ready to run. No matter what happens to me.
9774,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Come on!
9775,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I guess not. I think I'd be dead.
9776,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Absolutely.
9777,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Out.
9778,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Don't do that. It scares me.
9779,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Look!
9780,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"When the Ark gets loaded, we're already going to be on that plane."
9781,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Get out! Get out!
9782,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Where is it?
9783,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"You two get back to Cairo quick and get us transportation to England - a plane, a ship, anything."
9784,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I'm going to get that truck. I'll meet you at Omar's. Be ready for me.
9785,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I don't know. I'm making this up as I go.
9786,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,It's lovely.
9787,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,That's what you look like.
9788,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,What would you like to recapture?
9789,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Did I ever say I was sorry I burned down your tavern?
9790,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,You saved my life.
9791,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Seems things have worked out kind of even.
9792,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Maybe we should consider all past accounts closed.
9793,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,What else?
9794,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,The engines have shut down.
9795,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,I'm going to find out.
9796,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,What's wrong?
9797,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Holy shit.
9798,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Damn!
9799,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Hold it. One move from anybody and I blow that box back to Moses.
9800,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,What about you? Talked to God yet? Where's the girl?
9801,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want is the girl. We'll keep possession of the Ark only till we've got safe transport to England. Then it's all yours.
9802,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Then the Ark and some of us are going up in a big bang. I don't think Hitler would like that a bit. Now I don't want to talk about this anymore. Show me that girl in five seconds or -
9803,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,It's a bad habit. I'm trying to break it.
9804,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Thanks. If you talk to Him, tell Him I'm on my way up."
9805,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Marion! Marion, can you hear me?"
9806,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Hi.
9807,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Glad I could make it.
9808,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Let's get out of here.
9809,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Are you game?
9810,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Okay. Let's do it.
9811,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Whatever you do, don't touch it. Let's put it on the floor."
9812,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,We'll go down that side. Shoot anyone who looks at us crosseyed.
9813,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Get down!
9814,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,That's a powerful force. Research should be done -
9815,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,Who?
9816,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,We may be able to help.
9817,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,"Yeah, like what?"
9818,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark,INDY,It's not the Ark... but it'll have to do.
9819,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Lao She.
9820,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Wah hung how, nee nah? Wah hwey hung jing chee jah loo nee kao soo wah shu shu."
9821,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I don't like to show off.
9822,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat."
9823,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
9824,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,As I recall the deal was consid- erably more.
9825,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Aren't you going to introduce us?
9826,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Well -- I thought archaeologists were always funny little men searching for their mummies -- Aaahhh!
9827,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Put the gun away, sonny."
9828,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Now I suggest you pay me what you promised -- or your girlfriend here is going to be squealing a new tune.
9829,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Try again Lao -- the deal was more.
9830,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Look at this! He put a hole in my dress from Paris!
9831,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,What's that?
9832,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,This Nurhachi's a very small guy.
9833,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Inside are the remains of Nur- hachi -- the first Emperor of the Manchu Dynasty.
9834,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"So, what's the big deal? Let me see it --"
9835,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Ow, you're hurting me, you miser- able little hood!"
9836,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Let go of her, Lao. And give me the antidote."
9837,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Hey, he's not a waiter..."
9838,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along. So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao."
9839,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Wu Han -- listen to me -- I'm going to get you out of here.
9840,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,The antidote -- !
9841,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!"
9842,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Who cares? Where's that diamond!
9843,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Excuse me, but I believe that's my diamond!"
9844,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Aw nuts!
9845,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Hey,doll! Don't move!"
9846,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Step on it, Short Round!"
9847,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"For crying out loud, a kid's driv- ing the car?!"
9848,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Relax, I've been giving him lessons."
9849,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of gril!"
9850,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
9851,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,You don't look very good.
9852,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Poison never agrees with me. Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!"
9853,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Look at what you've done to me! I'm a mess! My lipstick's smeared, I broke two nails, I've got an aw- ful run in my stocking -- !"
9854,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Somehow I think you've got bigger problems.
9855,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
9856,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"The airport...No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!"
9857,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"You got the tickets, Short Round?"
9858,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Wu Han's not coming, Shorty."
9859,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I'll take the extra ticket. Where's this plane going anyway?
9860,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Siam.
9861,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam...
9862,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Thanks, Weber."
9863,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?"
9864,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?"
9865,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me."
9866,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Oh yeah?
9867,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Wake up! It's the drug he drank to stop the poison --
9868,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"You got to be kidding! No! No, I can't!"
9869,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Give me that parachute, I changed my mind --"
9870,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,We there yet?
9871,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,There's nobody flying the plane!
9872,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,No. Do you?
9873,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,You got it!
9874,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Short Round, what in the hell are you doing?"
9875,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!"
9876,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!"
9877,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Wait for me!
9878,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Okay, Shorty."
9879,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead. Oh no...I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
9880,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,India...
9881,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
9882,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What'd he say?
9883,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,He told me they knew I was coming here.
9884,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What do you mean -- how?
9885,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,The old man saw it in a dream.
9886,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
9887,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
9888,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I hope this means we're going to get some dinner.
9889,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"God, I am starving, but I can't eat this..."
9890,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"That's more food than these people eat in a week. They're starving, too..."
9891,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"I'm sorry, I -- here, please."
9892,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,We'd appreciate that. This was an unexpected detour. We'll have to go to Delhi now and find a flight west.
9893,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I'm a professor. I have to re- turn to the university. Can you give us a guide to take us to Delhi?
9894,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Thank you.
9895,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
9896,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Hasn't the Pankot palace been de- serted since the Mutiny of 1857?
9897,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I don't understand. What's hap- pened here?
9898,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,What evil?
9899,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Took what?
9900,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
9901,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
9902,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story."
9903,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Was the stone very smooth? It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
9904,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,And it had three lines painted across it? The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.
9905,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I don't understand how losing one rock could destroy this village. Is it really powerful?
9906,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
9907,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,He says that when the sacred stone was taken the village wells dried up first and then the river stopped.
9908,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,He says their crops dies and then the animals died.
9909,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,And then they took their children.
9910,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Their children?
9911,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"He says one night there was a fire in the fields. The men went to fight it. When they came back, they heard the women crying in the darkness. And the children were gone."
9912,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here."
9913,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I have friends in Delhi and I will make sure they investigate this...
9914,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What'd he say now?
9915,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
9916,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Sankara...
9917,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Damn it , Willie, get on -- we've got to move out!"
9918,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Whoa! Easy now -- nice elephant...
9919,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty."
9920,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
9921,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Figures...
9922,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"All right, let's go. I want to get to Pankot before tomorrow night."
9923,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Pankot?! I thought we were going to Delhi! Hey, wait a minute! Can't somebody take me to Delhi?! I don't want to go to Pankot!"
9924,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I think you need this more than me.
9925,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Those are very big bird.
9926,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Those aren't birds -- those are giant bats.
9927,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,They must be pretty dumb to drink that awful-looking water.
9928,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I think maybe we'll camp here.
9929,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now."
9930,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach."
9931,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off. I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water."
9932,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Somehow I feel safer in here.
9933,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Indy! Help me!
9934,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?"
9935,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,A snake!
9936,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,A what...?
9937,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,A SNAKE!!
9938,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea."
9939,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What?!
9940,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,First of all -- don't panic!
9941,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"It's got me ! Indy, help me!"
9942,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Don't let it pull you deeper!
9943,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,It's pulling me deeper!
9944,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Don't let it curl around you!
9945,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!"
9946,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now."
9947,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What?!
9948,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Can you move your arm?
9949,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Just one arm!
9950,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake."
9951,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,PET IT??!!
9952,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal verte- brae."
9953,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,THE WHAT?!
9954,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!"
9955,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
9956,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Keep stroking it!
9957,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,It's starting to let go!
9958,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,That's good -- you're doing fine.
9959,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,It's letting fo. I think it's -- I think it's going to sleep!
9960,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,See -- I got you out...
9961,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
9962,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I know the feeling...
9963,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Where'd you find your little body- guard?
9964,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
9965,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
9966,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?"
9967,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that ""a girl could go places in the Orient..."" So, look where I got."
9968,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,What about the future?
9969,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, in- credibly rich prince."
9970,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I'd like to find one of those myself.
9971,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Oh really?
9972,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years. Fortune and glory..."
9973,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?"
9974,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Maybe...
9975,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What's that?
9976,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Something that kid gave me last night. It's a piece of an old manuscript.
9977,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What does the writing say?
9978,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
9979,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
9980,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
9981,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
9982,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,It could be.
9983,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Fortune and glory...sweet dreams, Dr. Jones."
9984,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I think you should sleep closer. I meant for safety.
9985,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
9986,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Did you see it?! It was one of those bats! God, what else is out there...?!"
9987,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Couldn't keep away, huh?"
9988,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Just try and control yourself.
9989,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Still scared? Okay, Willie, you can get closer if you want..."
9990,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Honey, I knew you'd be the first one to give in..."
9991,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,That's it. Pankot Palace.
9992,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Why are we stopping here?
9993,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Just a statue.
9994,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What's the guide talking about? He hasn't said a word the whole trip.
9995,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,He's afraid of something.
9996,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
9997,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
9998,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"-- shot at, fallen out of a plane, nearly drowned, squashed by a snake, attacked by a bat -- I smell like an elephant! I tell you I'm not going to make it!"
9999,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Any more complaints?
10000,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner..."
10001,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,It doesn't feel like there's been any permanent damage.
10002,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Hello?... ...
10003,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Hi... ... ...
10004,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones."
10005,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Hard to believe, isn't it...?"
10006,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,How'd you like to run into him in a dark alley...that one's kind of cute...I could see myself married to a prince like that...
10007,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,You should have been there...
10008,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,We'd appreciate it if the Mahara- jah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morn- ing.
10009,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Is that him?
10010,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Oh -- good. And maybe the pres- ent Marahajah is a little younger? And thinner?
10011,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to to get ready!"
10012,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,You look like a princess.
10013,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,It's sort of like being in heaven.
10014,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
10015,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub."
10016,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?"
10017,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman..."
10018,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a krtya.
10019,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
10020,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,You think so?
10021,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
10022,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
10023,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I think this Maharajah is swim- ming in money. Maybe coming here wasn't such a bad idea.
10024,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Finally!
10025,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
10026,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Maybe he likes older women.
10027,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way."
10028,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I've never been so hungry in my life...
10029,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"My god, sort of grusome, isn't it...?"
10030,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,We are honored to be here.
10031,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Suddenly I'm not so hungry...
10032,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"I had a question, Mr. Prime Mini- ster. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts."
10033,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Yes, very fine. But not all of the pieces look old. Some were carved recently and look like images used by the Thuggees to worship the god- des Kali."
10034,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I uh -- had bugs for lunch.
10035,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
10036,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peas- ants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- becuase of some ancient evil."
10037,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Maybe.. but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
10038,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Give me your hat...
10039,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I'm going to puke in it...
10040,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
10041,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore."
10042,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Something magical. A sacred rock.
10043,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,When they lost this rock their fields and animals dies. They also said their children were taken from them.
10044,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"So you have something, you know, simple -- like soup or something?"
10045,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I wanna go home...
10046,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I was dubious muself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
10047,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,The newspapers exaggerated the incident
10048,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,That was a misunderstanding.
10049,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I'm sorry if I've offended you.
10050,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat. Makes you wonder what these people are..."
10051,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"We're guests here, Shorty."
10052,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"You wish is my command, your Highness."
10053,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Okay, Short Round, let go of it."
10054,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,You don't like him do you?
10055,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,No.
10056,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
10057,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I better see how Willie is.
10058,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I brought you something.
10059,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Not leftovers?
10060,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,No -- real food.
10061,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Oh, it is real food...it's beautiful."
10062,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Wearing your jewels to be, prin- cess?"
10063,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Yeah -- and nothing else. That shock you?
10064,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain ""nocturnal activities"" --"
10065,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,You mean like love rituals...
10066,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,And mating customs...
10067,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Primitive sexual practices?
10068,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,You're taling to an authority in that area.
10069,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?"
10070,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?"
10071,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?"
10072,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"I think you're too used to get- ting you own way, Willie..."
10073,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
10074,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Don't catch cold.
10075,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Dr. Jones -- ?
10076,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door."
10077,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Five minutes... fat chance.
10078,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Five minutes, Dr. Jones..."
10079,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,...want me to be her palace slave!
10080,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Okay, Shorty ... see you in the morning...I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie."
10081,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,He's not coming...I can't be- lieve it...
10082,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"It's okay, it's over -- go turn off the fan."
10083,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,This a cheap trick to get me over here?
10084,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,No -- don't you see -- crawling --
10085,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,What -- the bug?
10086,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Get -- the -- bug -- off!
10087,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!"
10088,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Oh no -- oh no!!
10089,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner."
10090,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!"
10091,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What did I do to deserve this trip?!
10092,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I'm packing! I'm getting out of here right now tonight!
10093,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,* .
10094,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"""Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."""
10095,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,*
10096,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"I don't care if I have to walk to Delhi, I'm -- hey!"
10097,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Lock your door and don't leave until we get back.
10098,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"You're right, there's something all over the floor..."
10099,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,There's a chamber here. Come on --
10100,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Damn!
10101,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Hey -- where are you?!
10102,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Yes, we're in here..."
10103,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Uh -- Willie?! Willie, you better get down here!"
10104,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What?!
10105,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!"
10106,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Willie, damn it! Get down here, NOW"
10107,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Oh hell -- I bet I get all dirty again!
10108,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,WILLIE?!
10109,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!"
10110,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Move, Willie! Faster!"
10111,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,It's all wet and icky! Aaahh -- things are moving!!
10112,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
10113,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!"
10114,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,OPEN THE DOOR! LET ME IN!!
10115,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a ful- crum release! Look around!"
10116,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,A what?!
10117,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,A fulcrum release lever!
10118,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
10119,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Look around, Willie! There's got to be a liever hidden somewhere! Come on, you can do it!"
10120,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,There's a hole! I found a square hole!
10121,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
10122,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I am -- it looks horrible!
10123,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Reach inside!
10124,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"I can't, Indy! I can't!"
10125,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"The lever! Willie, do it! NOW!"
10126,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!"
10127,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Willie!
10128,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Get is off me -- get it off!
10129,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Not that one! We had enought of that one, thank you..."
10130,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What is it...?
10131,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're whorshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction."
10132,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
10133,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,No...the heart's still beating!
10134,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Let's go! Let's get out of here!
10135,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Quiet!
10136,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
10137,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow.
10138,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Diamonds...?
10139,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Okay -- now listen -- you wait here and keep quiet. Shorty, keep an eye on her."
10140,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Wait -- what're you doing?
10141,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I'm going down.
10142,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Down? Down there?! Are you crazy --!
10143,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I'm not leaving without those stones.
10144,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
10145,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Maybe...someday. Not today.
10146,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Oh hell, where's he going?"
10147,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What're you -- ?
10148,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Why?
10149,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,What is that?
10150,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village."
10151,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Two are still missing.
10152,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,That's what you've got these chil- dren -- these slaves digging for?
10153,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
10154,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Oh my God, you scared me! Listen, you've got to help. We found this tunnel --"
10155,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,No -- you can't go! Something aw- ful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
10156,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"We found a tennel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!"
10157,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
10158,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
10159,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!
10160,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"What're we playing, hid and seek?"
10161,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Oh, Indy, you got away! Tell them what happened, they won't believe me --"
10162,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,It's okay. You're all right now.
10163,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ..."
10164,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Hey, I thought you were supposed to be a real tropper. Willie?"
10165,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What?
10166,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,You've got to go to sleep now.
10167,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I want to go home...
10168,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vaca- tion...
10169,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
10170,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,When she saw the insects she passed out cold. I carried her back to her room. She was sleeping when I re-entered the tunnel to look around.
10171,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
10172,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Nothing. Just a dead end. That tunnel's been deserted for years.
10173,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Thanks, but I don't think Willie is ready to travel yet."
10174,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Indy? Did you walk to them?
10175,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Yes.
10176,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,So now they believe me.
10177,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Yes, they believe you."
10178,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Then they'll send the soldiers down into the temple...
10179,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,No... they won't kill me.
10180,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
10181,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"You won't lose me, Willie..."
10182,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,No! I've found it -- you can't -- Kali knows!
10183,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,-- been too many lies -- there's no god's heaven -- just -- the horror! I've seen it -- life preying on life!
10184,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,-- rivers -- destroying mountains -- a comet in space -- exploding! Aaahh! -- the screams -- pitiful people -- their pain -- the hate -- and greed -- always greed!
10185,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,-- but I've found -- Kali's touch! Death -- no more lies -- the death I've been searching for! Quit crying! She can hear you -- Kali knows fear -- don't you under- stand -- Kali is freedom!
10186,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Yes, I understand."
10187,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Kali Ma protects us now and for- ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!"
10188,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Indy! Help me! Indy?!
10189,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Please, God, don't let them do this to me -- help me, Indy!"
10190,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,No! Give him to me!
10191,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Look out -- !
10192,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Come on, quick!"
10193,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What're we going to do?
10194,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,We're going to get them out of here -- !
10195,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Ah, sir? Excuse me --"
10196,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"No, wait!"
10197,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What're we going to do?!
10198,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,There's got to be another way out.
10199,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Those empty cars have got to go out of the mines.
10200,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I can't!
10201,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Go!
10202,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,We've got to get across to the empty cars. Wait here until I signal you.
10203,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Come on!
10204,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,I see the problem...
10205,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What happened?
10206,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What's wrong with him?
10207,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"I got one! Indy, I got one!"
10208,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Indy, look out!"
10209,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Get down here, Shorty! I got us a ride!"
10210,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
10211,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Come here and take the brake!
10212,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Let up on the brake!
10213,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
10214,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What above the curves?!
10215,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What're you doing?! We're going too fast!!
10216,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Get over on the other side!
10217,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"One down, one to go!"
10218,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Anymore ideas...?
10219,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
10220,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Okay -- one -- two -- NOW!
10221,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Okay, Shorty, hit the brakes!"
10222,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Grab onto me -- I'm going to try and slow us down from underneath!
10223,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Oh no!
10224,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,What's wrong?
10225,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Ouch...
10226,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I'm okay -- I'm fine -- I love to flirt with death...
10227,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,What's that?...Indy?!
10228,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Oh... shit...
10229,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,There! Dive!
10230,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Lucky I found a short cut. Look, there's a light at the end of the tunnel..."
10231,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Some short cut!
10232,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Willie -- the bridge! Climb up to the bridge!
10233,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,Indy -- looks out behind you!
10234,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Let my friends go!
10235,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"You want the stones, let them go and call off your guards!"
10236,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Then I guess we're all going to take a big dive!
10237,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
10238,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,You're betrayed Shiva. *
10239,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
10240,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,Not quite.
10241,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,And the diamond hidden inside...
10242,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,It's a real miracle.
10243,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Yes, I've seen its power"
10244,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,The last Sankara Stone.
10245,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,And they don't even know what it really is.
10246,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,"Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond."
10247,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've got- ten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
10248,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,INDY,It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen.
10249,Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom,WILLIE,"Oh no, I'm finding a native guide who knows the way. No more de- tours for me, thank you Dr. Jones."
10250,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"And here comes the scare-baby, my kid brother, Harry Bailey."
10251,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,I'm not scared.
10252,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I'm coming, Harry."
10253,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Make a chain, gang! A chain!"

10259,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Yes, sir."
10260,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Hello, Violet."
10261,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Two cents worth of shoelaces?
10262,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,I'm still thinking.
10263,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Shoelaces?
10264,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,You like every boy.

10269,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,With coconuts?
10270,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,I don't like coconuts.
10271,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"You don't like coconuts! Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here  from Tahiti  Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!"
10272,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,A new magazine! I never saw it before.
10273,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
10274,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Is this the ear you can't hear on? George Bailey, I'll love you till the day I die."
10275,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I'm going out exploring some day, you watch. And I'm going to have a couple of harems, and maybe three or four wives. Wait and see."
10276,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Yes, sir."
10277,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"No, sir."
10278,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Mr. Gower, do you want something... Anything?"
10279,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Anything I can do back here?
10280,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I'll get them, sir."
10281,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?"
10282,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Is it a charge, sir?"
10283,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Mr. Gower, I think..."
10284,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Yes, sir."
10285,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy."
10286,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,It's important.
10287,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I'm not crying, Mr. Potter."
10288,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,All I'm asking is thirty days more...
10289,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Pop!
10290,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Just a minute, son. Just thirty short days. I'll dig up that five thousand somehow."
10291,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Pop!
10292,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work."
10293,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I can't do that. These families have children.
10294,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Pop!
10295,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,But they're somebody's children.
10296,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, all right..."
10297,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hardskulled character? You have no family  no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got."
10298,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,He's not a failure! You can't say that about my father!
10299,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"George, George..."
10300,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,You're not! You're the biggest man in town!
10301,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Run along.
10302,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Bigger'n him!
10303,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Bigger'n everybody.
10304,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Don't let him say that about you, Pop."
10305,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"All right, son, thanks. I'll talk to you tonight."
10306,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Capsules...
10307,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Yes, sir, I..."
10308,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,You're hurting my sore ear.
10309,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Mr. Gower, you don't know what you're doing. You put something wrong in those capsules. I know you're unhappy. You got that telegram, and you're upset. You put something bad in those capsules. It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower..."
10310,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Just look and see what you did. Look at the bottle you took the powder from. It's poison! I tell you, it's poison! I know you feel bad... and..."
10311,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Don't hurt my sore ear again.
10312,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Don't hurt my ear again!
10313,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't."
10314,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Now, look, Joe. Now, look, I... I want a big one."
10315,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Big - see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand... a great big one."
10316,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?"
10317,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge."
10318,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,What's my name doing on it?
10319,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,He did? Whatta you know about that  my old boss...
10320,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I'm working across on a cattle boat.
10321,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Okay, I like cows."
10322,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Mr. Gower... Mr. Gower... thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
10323,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, it's wonderful."
10324,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Oh... Oh. Wish I had a million dollars.
10325,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Hot dog!
10326,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hey, Ernie!"
10327,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hi, Bert."
10328,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?"
10329,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there."
10330,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Yes...
10331,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,I've eaten.
10332,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,I don't care. It's George's tux.
10333,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"Annie, I'm in love with you. There's a moon out tonight."
10334,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy  my last meal at the old Bailey boarding house."
10335,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things."
10336,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen."
10337,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, let him have the plates, Mother."
10338,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired."
10339,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Oh...
10340,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I wonder what's eating that old money grubbing buzzard anyway?
10341,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"Gangway! Gangway! So long, Pop."
10342,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Got a match?
10343,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,Very funny. Very funny.
10344,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?"
10345,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"What do you mean, and be bored to death?"
10346,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too."
10347,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I hope it works.
10348,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"Aw, Pop, just a little."
10349,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?"
10350,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go."
10351,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, no younger than I was."
10352,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,How's that?
10353,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about  build things... design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff I was talking about."
10354,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"No, I'll settle for half that in cash."
10355,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, I... Annie, why don't you draw up a chair? Then you'd be more comfortable and you could hear everything that's going on."
10356,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"You would, huh?"
10357,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office."
10358,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean that remark, but this business of nickels and dimes and spending all your life trying to figure out how to save three cents on a length of pipe... I'd go crazy. I want to do something big and something important."
10359,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I know, Dad. I wish I felt... But I've been hoarding pennies like a miser in order to... Most of my friends have already finished college. I just feel like if I don't get away, I'd bust."
10360,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?"
10361,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy."
10362,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, did you hear that, Annie?"
10363,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party."
10364,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Here you are.
10365,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"You know my kid brother, George. I'm going to put him through college."
10366,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,"Here comes George. Hello, hee-haw!"
10367,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?"
10368,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,"Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat."
10369,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Old college graduate now, huh?"
10370,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,"Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all."
10371,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Yep.
10372,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,Harry! You're the guy I want to see. Coach has heard all about you.
10373,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,He has?
10374,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,Yeah. He's followed every game and his mouth's watering. He wants me to find out if you're going to come along with us.
10375,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"Well, I gotta make some dough first."
10376,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,"Well, you better make it fast. We need great ends like you  not broken down old guys like this one."
10377,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Hee-haw!
10378,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,Hee-haw!
10379,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?"
10380,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hello, Violet."
10381,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week."
10382,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,What's that?
10383,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
10384,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,"""Momma wants you, Marty."" ""Momma wants you, Marty."" Remember?"
10385,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh... me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids."
10386,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,"Aw, go on."
10387,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, excuse me, Violet. Don't be long, Marty. I don't want to be a wet nurse for..."
10388,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Well... Well... Well...
10389,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, why don't you stop annoying people?"
10390,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, hello."
10391,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
10392,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, I don't."
10393,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,You've passed me on the street almost every day.
10394,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Me?
10395,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Uh-huh.
10396,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
10397,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,Oyez  oyez  oyez... The big Charleston contest. The prize? A genuine loving cup. Those not tapped by the judges will remain on the floor. Let's go!
10398,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I'm not very good at this.
10399,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Neither am I.
10400,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Okay  what can we lose?
10401,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,They're cheering us. We must be good.
10402,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Hot dog! Just like an organ.
10403,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Beautiful.
10404,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"And I told Harry I thought I'd be bored to death. You should have seen the commotion in that locker room. I had to knock down three people to get this stuff we're wearing here. Here, let me hold that old wet dress of yours."
10405,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Do I look as funny as you do?
10406,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I guess I'm not quite the football type. You... look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town."
10407,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Well, why don't you say it?"
10408,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
10409,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Eighteen.
10410,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen."
10411,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Too young or too old?
10412,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on."
10413,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I mean, without a dress. You look older... I mean, younger. You look just..."
10414,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Oh-oh...
10415,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Sir, my train, please."
10416,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.
10417,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Your... your caboose, my lady."
10418,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,You may kiss my hand.
10419,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Ummmmm...
10420,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hey  hey, Mary."
10421,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,As I was lumbering down the street...
10422,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house."
10423,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Oh, no, don't. I love that old house."
10424,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"No. You see, you make a wish and then try and break some glass. You got to be a pretty good shot nowadays, too."
10425,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it."
10426,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,In that place?
10427,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Uh-huh.
10428,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch... right on the second floor there.
10429,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"What'd you wish, George?"
10430,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know... and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long..."
10431,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Are you gonna throw a rock?
10432,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hey, that's pretty good. What'd you wish, Mary?"
10433,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Buffalo Gals, can't you come out tonight..."
10434,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,What'd you wish when you threw that rock?
10435,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Oh, no."
10436,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Come on, tell me."
10437,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,If I told you it might not come true.
10438,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say..."
10439,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"...the word and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down. Hey, that's a pretty good idea. I'll give you the moon, Mary."
10440,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,I'll take it. And then what?
10441,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair. Am I talking too much?"
10442,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,How's that?
10443,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Want me to kiss her, huh?"
10444,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hey, hey, hold on. Hey, mister, come on back out here, and I'll show you some kissing that'll put hair back on your head. What are you..."
10445,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Mary...
10446,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Okay, I give up. Where are you?"
10447,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Over here in the hydrangea bushes.
10448,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Here you are. Catch.
10449,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Wait a minute. What am I doing? This is a very interesting situation.
10450,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Please give me my robe.
10451,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Hmm... A man doesn't get in a situation like this every day.
10452,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,I'd like to have my robe.
10453,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Not in Bedford Falls, anyway."
10454,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Ouch!
10455,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
10456,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,George Bailey! Give me my robe!
10457,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I've heard about things like this, but I've never..."
10458,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Shame on you. I'm going to tell your mother on you.
10459,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, my mother's way up the corner there."
10460,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,I'll call the police.
10461,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too."
10462,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,I'm going to scream!
10463,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Maybe I could sell tickets. Let's see. No, the point is, in order to get this robe... I've got it! I'll make a deal with you, Mary."
10464,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Mary... Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go."
10465,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"Come on, George, let's hurry."
10466,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Did you get a doctor?
10467,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I have a taxi waiting downstairs.
10468,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Thanks.
10469,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Thank you very much.
10470,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter. You have all the papers there. His salary, insurance. I can personally vouch for his character."
10471,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Yes, sir."
10472,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Just a minute  just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was... Why, in the twenty- five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why... Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You... you said... What'd you say just a minute ago?... They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken- down that they... Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about... they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!"
10473,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know. Well, I've said too much. I... You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!"
10474,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Yeah, I'll be right down."
10475,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I wonder what's going on in there?
10476,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,What's that?
10477,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy..."
10478,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Dr. Campbell, now let's get this thing straight. I'm leaving. I'm leaving right now. I'm going to school. This is my last chance. Uncle Billy here, he's your man."
10479,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, there are plenty of jobs around for somebody that likes to travel. Look at this. There... Venezuela oil fields  wanted, man with construction experience. Here's the Yukon, right here  wanted, man with engineering experience."
10480,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Thar she blows. You know what the three most exciting sounds in the world are?
10481,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles."
10482,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"There's the professor now! Old professor, Phi Beta Kappa Bailey! All American!"
10483,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"Well, if it isn't old George Geographic Explorer Bailey! What? No husky dogs? No sled? Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a bit."
10484,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, am I glad to see you."
10485,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"Say, where's Mother?"
10486,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go."
10487,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"Oh, wait. Wait... Wait a minute."
10488,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Hello.
10489,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,Ruth Dakin.
10490,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"Well, I wired you I had a surprise. Here she is. Meet the wife."
10491,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?"
10492,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Harry, why didn't you tell somebody? What's a pretty girl like you doing marrying this two-headed brother of mine?"
10493,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"George... about that job. Ruth spoke out of turn. I never said I'd take it. You've been holding the bag here for four years, and... well, I won't let you down, George. I would like to... Oh, wait a minute. I forgot the bags. I'll be right back."
10494,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Ruth, this... what about this job?"
10495,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Is it a good job?
10496,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"And you did, too?"
10497,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,The middle one.
10498,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Right down here.
10499,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
10500,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hello, Mom."
10501,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,She's swell.
10502,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway."
10503,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Uh-huh.
10504,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Hmmmm...
10505,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Hmmmm...
10506,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Hmmm...
10507,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Hmmm...
10508,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Sure  Sam Wainwright.
10509,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
10510,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?"
10511,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well then, how do you know?"
10512,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Oh...
10513,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,And all's fair in love and war?
10514,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Mother, you know, I can see right through you  right back to your back collar button... trying to get rid of me, huh?"
10515,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking."
10516,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction... This direction? Good night, Mrs. Bailey."
10517,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hello, Vi."
10518,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Nothing.
10519,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library."
10520,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Yes... what are you doing tonight?
10521,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Are you game, Vi? Let's make a night of it."
10522,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
10523,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Then we can go up to the falls. It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it. Then we can climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and... we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a terrific scandal..."
10524,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Shhh...
10525,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Okay, just forget about the whole thing."
10526,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"What are you doing, picketing?"
10527,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by."
10528,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?"
10529,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,How's that?
10530,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Have you made up your mind?
10531,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,About what?
10532,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
10533,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?"
10534,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Didn't you tell her?
10535,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by...
10536,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"What do you... went for a walk, that's all."
10537,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"I'll be downstairs, mother."
10538,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Well, are you coming in or aren't you?"
10539,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here."
10540,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,When did you get back?
10541,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Tuesday.
10542,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Where'd you get that dress?
10543,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Do you like it?
10544,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them."
10545,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know... I guess I was homesick."
10546,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Homesick? For Bedford Falls?
10547,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Yes, and my family and... oh, everything. Would you like to sit down?"
10548,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here."
10549,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Would you rather leave?
10550,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"No, I don't want to be rude."
10551,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Well, then, sit down."
10552,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Some joke, huh?"
10553,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here."
10554,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Thank you.
10555,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"""And dance by the light..."""
10556,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"What's the matter? Oh, yeah... yeah..."
10557,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, I..."
10558,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"It was nice about your brother Harry, and Ruth, wasn't it?"
10559,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh... yeah, yeah. That's all right."
10560,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Don't you like her?
10561,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, of course I like her. She's a peach."
10562,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?"
10563,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you."
10564,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"It's George Bailey, Mother."
10565,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,I don't know. What do you want?
10566,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Me? Not a thing. I just came in to get warm.
10567,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"He's making violent love to me, Mother."
10568,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,But your mother needn't... you know I didn't come here to... to... to...
10569,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,What did you come here for?
10570,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I don't know. You tell me. You're supposed to be the one that has all the answers. You tell me.
10571,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Oh, why don't you go home?"
10572,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,That's where I'm going. I don't know why I came here in the first place! Good night!
10573,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Good night!
10574,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,I'll get it.
10575,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Hello.
10576,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I forgot my hat.
10577,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?"
10578,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Oh, well, that's awfully sweet of you, Sam. There's an old friend of yours here. George Bailey."
10579,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,You mean old moss-back George?
10580,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Yes, old moss-back George."
10581,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Wait a minute. I'll call him. George!
10582,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"He does so. He asked for him. Geo... George, Sam wants to speak to you."
10583,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hello, Sam."
10584,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,"Well, George Baileyoffski! Hey, a fine pal you are. What're you trying to do? Steal my girl?"
10585,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,What do you mean? Nobody's trying to steal your girl. Here... here's Mary.
10586,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Here. You take it. You tell him.
10587,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Mother's on the extension.
10588,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,We can both hear. Come here.
10589,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"We're listening, Sam."
10590,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah... soybeans. Yeah.
10591,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Rochester? Well, why Rochester?"
10592,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, I don't know... why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down."
10593,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Money? Yeah... well, a little."
10594,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,I'm here.
10595,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,He says it's the chance of a lifetime.
10596,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Now you listen to me! I don't want any plastics! I don't want any ground floors, and I don't want to get married  ever  to anyone! You understand that? I want to do what I want to do. And you're... and you're..."
10597,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, Mary... Mary..."
10598,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,George... George... George...
10599,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Mary...
10600,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab."
10601,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, look at this. Champagne!"
10602,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Good old Bert.
10603,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Where are we going? Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary."
10604,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,I feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look!
10605,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels  the oldest champagne  the richest caviar  the hottest music, and the prettiest wife!"
10606,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Then what, honey?"
10607,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"After that, who cares?"
10608,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,That does it  come here.
10609,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"George, let's not stop. Let's go!"
10610,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh..."
10611,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Please, let's not stop, George."
10612,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I'll be back in a minute, Mary."
10613,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hello, everybody. Mrs. Thompson, how are you? Charlie? What's the matter here, can't you get in?"
10614,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?"
10615,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Come on in, everybody. That's right, just come in."
10616,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Now look, why don't you all sit down. There are a lot of seats over there. Just make yourselves at home."
10617,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Why didn't you call me?
10618,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"All right now, what happened? How did it start?"
10619,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,When?
10620,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,All of it?
10621,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Holy mackerel!
10622,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,The whole town's gone crazy.
10623,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Hello?
10624,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Police? What for?
10625,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,He just took over the bank.
10626,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Aw, you never miss a trick, do you, Potter? Well, you're going to miss this one."
10627,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Yeah... ...you can take this one off now.
10628,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Now, just remember that this thing isn't as black as it appears."
10629,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I have some news for you, folks. I've just talked to old man Potter, and he's guaranteed cash payments at the bank. The bank's going to reopen next week."
10630,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask him. We don't need Potter over here."
10631,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"No, but you... you... you're thinking of this place all wrong. As if I had the money back in a safe. The money's not here. Your money's in Joe's house... ...right next to yours. And in the Kennedy house, and Mrs. Macklin's house, and a hundred others. Why, you're lending them the money to build, and then, they're going to pay it back to you as best they can. Now what are you going to do? Foreclose on them?"
10632,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Okay, Tom. All right. Here you are. You sign this. You'll get your money in sixty days."
10633,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, now that's what you agreed to when you bought your shares."
10634,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Now, Tom, you have to stick to your original agreement. Now give us sixty days on this."
10635,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Tom! Tom! Randall! Now wait... now listen... now listen to me. I beg of you not to do this thing. If Potter gets hold of this Building and Loan there'll never be another decent house built in this town. He's already got charge of the bank. He's got the bus line. He's got the department stores. And now he's after us. Why? Well, it's very simple. Because we're cutting in on his business, that's why. And because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides."
10636,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Joe, you lived in one of his houses, didn't you? Well, have you forgotten? Have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken-down shack? Here, Ed. You know, you remember last year when things weren't going so well, and you couldn't make your payments. You didn't lose your house, did you? Do you think Potter would have let you keep it? Can't you understand what's happening here? Don't you see what's happening? Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying! And why? Because we're panicky and he's not. That's why. He's picking up some bargains. Now, we can get through this thing all right. We've got to stick together, though. We've got to have faith in each other."
10637,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,How much do you need?
10638,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hey! I got two thousand dollars! Here's two thousand dollars. This'll tide us over until the bank reopen. All right, Tom, how much do you need?"
10639,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Aw, Tom, just enough to tide you over till the bank reopens."
10640,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,There you are.
10641,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Your account's still here. That's a loan.
10642,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Okay. All right, Ed?"
10643,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Aw, now, Ed... what'll it take till the bank reopens? What do you need?"
10644,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Twenty dollars. Now you're talking. Fine. Thanks, Ed. All right, now, Mrs. Thompson. How much do you want?"
10645,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Never mind about that. How much do you want?
10646,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Twenty dollars.
10647,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"You don't have to sign anything. I know you'll pay it back when you can. That's okay. All right, Mrs. Davis."
10648,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Seven... Bless your heart, Of course you can have it. You got fifty cents? Seven..."
10649,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Six... five... four... three... two... one... Bingo!
10650,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"We made it! Look... ... look, we're still in business! We've still got two bucks left!"
10651,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, let's have some of that. Get some glasses, Cousin Tilly. We're a couple of financial wizards."
10652,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
10653,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"A toast! A toast to Papa Dollar and to Mama Dollar, and if you want the old Building and Loan to stay in business, you better have a family real quick."
10654,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I wish they were too. Okay, let's put them in the safe and see what happens."
10655,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh-oh... wedding! Holy mackerel, I'm married! Where's Mary? Mary... Poor Mary. Look, I've got a train to catch. Well, the train's gone. I wonder if Ernie's still here with his taxicab?"
10656,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Look, will you get my wife on the phone? She's probably over at her mother's."
10657,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I don't want Mrs. Bailey. I want my wife. Mrs. Bailey! Oh, that's my wife! Here, I'll take it in here. Mary? Hello. Listen, dear, I'm sorry... What? Come home? What home? Three-twenty Sycamore? Well, what... whose home is that? The Waldorf Hotel, huh?"
10658,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Welcome home, Mr. Bailey."
10659,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, I'll be... Mary, Mary, where did you..."
10660,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, Mary..."
10661,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
10662,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Darling, you're wonderful."
10663,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,What's that?
10664,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Come on... Bring the baby. I'll bring the kids in the car.
10665,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"All right, kids  here  get in here. Now get right up on the seat there. Get the... get the goat!"
10666,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,All in...
10667,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Mr. and Mrs. Martini, welcome home. The Martinis cross themselves."
10668,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,That old George... he's always making a speech. Hee-haw!
10669,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Sam Wainwright!
10670,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Oh, who cares. Bread! That this house may never know hunger."
10671,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Salt! That life may always have flavor.
10672,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,And wine! That joy and prosperity may reign forever. Enter the Martini castle!
10673,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,"We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're going to drive on down to Florida."
10674,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Oh...
10675,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,JANE,Why don't you have your friends join us?
10676,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,"Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids drive down with us, huh?"
10677,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam."
10678,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,"Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold."
10679,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, now, don't rub it in."
10680,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,"I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along."
10681,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,JANE,"Awfully glad to have met you, Mary."
10682,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Nice meeting you.
10683,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Goodbye.
10684,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,JANE,"Goodbye, George."
10685,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,"So long, George. See you in the funny papers."
10686,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Goodbye, Sam."
10687,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Have fun.
10688,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Thanks for dropping around.
10689,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,SAM,To Florida! Hee-haw!
10690,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Hee-haw.
10691,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter."
10692,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, I... I suppose I'll find out sooner or later, but just what exactly did you want to see me about?"
10693,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest."
10694,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Forty-five!
10695,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Now what's your point, Mr. Potter?"
10696,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Hire me?
10697,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Twenty thou... twenty thousand dollars a year?
10698,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Would I? You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey."
10699,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, what about the Building and Loan?"
10700,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, Mr. Potter, I... I... I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I... I just... I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty- four hours to think it over?"
10701,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I'd like to do that.
10702,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"All right, sir."
10703,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Okay, Mr. Potter."
10704,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"No... no... no... no, now wait a minute, here! I don't have to talk to anybody! I know right now, and the answer is no! NO! Doggone it! You sit around here and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter! In the... in the whole vast configuration of things, I'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider. You..."
10705,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,...And that goes for you too!
10706,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,And it goes for you too!
10707,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight, won't you come out tonight, won't you come out tonight."
10708,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Hi.
10709,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Hi.
10710,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?"
10711,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,To keep from being an old maid.
10712,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
10713,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
10714,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you... ...Your what?
10715,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,My baby.
10716,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"You mean... Mary, you on the nest?"
10717,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,George Bailey lassos stork.
10718,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Lassos the stork! You mean you... What is it, a boy or a girl?"
10719,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Hold on... hold on... hold on now. Don't you know there's a war on?
10720,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hi, Ernie, look at that."
10721,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,What do you mean  it's gonna snow again? Look at the headlines.
10722,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Commander Harry Bailey. Mr. Gower, look at this  the second page. Now look, this is for you. This is for you, this is for you. See you again."
10723,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Extra! Extra! Read all about it!
10724,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Harry! What do you know about that?
10725,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"What do you mean it's okay? For a hero? Harry! Oh, you old seven kinds of a son of a gun. Congratulations! How's Mother standing it?... She did? What do you know... Mother had lunch with the President's wife!"
10726,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"What did they have to eat? Harry, you should see what they're cooking up in the town for you... Oh, are they? The Navy's going to fly Mother home this afternoon."
10727,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,What? Uncle Billy? Has Uncle Billy come in yet?
10728,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"He's not here right now, Harry."
10729,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,But look...
10730,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,...now tell me about it.
10731,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,What man?
10732,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh... Talk to Eustace a minute, will you. I'll be right back."
10733,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Good morning, sir."
10734,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas."
10735,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,We're all excited around here. My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
10736,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke."
10737,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well... ...now, come right in here, Mr. Carter."
10738,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"No, no. He wants to talk to Uncle Billy. You just hold on."
10739,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter, Just step right in here. We'll fix you up."
10740,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Just make yourself at home, Mr. Carter. I'll get those books for you."
10741,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, hello, Vi."
10742,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here."
10743,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Uncle Billy, talk to Harry. He's on the telephone."
10744,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Here you are.
10745,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"It takes a lot of character to leave your home town and start all over again. He pulls some money from his pocket, and offers it to her."
10746,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?"
10747,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls."
10748,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"It's a loan. That's my business. Building and Loan. Besides, you'll get a job. Good luck to you."
10749,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Say hello to New York for me.
10750,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Now, let's hear from you..."
10751,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"What's the matter? Merry Christmas, Vi."
10752,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, Mr. Carter, I'm sorry. I'll be right with you. Uncle Billy in?"
10753,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Unc... What's going on? The bank examiner's here, and I..."
10754,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. He wants the accounts payable..."
10755,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,What's the matter with you?
10756,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Eustace...
10757,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Come here a minute.
10758,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Did you see Uncle Billy with any cash last night?
10759,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Now look, did you buy anything?"
10760,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
10761,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
10762,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Maybe  maybe! I don't want any maybe. Uncle Billy, we've got to find that money!"
10763,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Listen to me. Do you have any secret hiding place here in the house? Someplace you could have put it? Someplace to hide the money?
10764,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Listen to me! Listen to me! Think! Think!
10765,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Where's that money, you stupid, silly old fool? Where's the money? Do you realize what this means? It means bankruptcy and scandal, and prison!"
10766,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"That's what it means! One of us is going to jail! Well, it's not going to be me!"
10767,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Hello darling.
10768,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,How do you like it?
10769,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Did you bring the wreath?
10770,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,What? What wreath?
10771,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,The Merry Christmas wreath for the window.
10772,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,No. I left it at the office.
10773,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Is it snowing?
10774,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Yeah, just started."
10775,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Where's your coat and hat?
10776,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Left them at the office.
10777,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,What's the matter?
10778,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Nothing's the matter. Everything's all right.
10779,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Go on, Pete, you're a big boy. You can put the star up. Way up at the top. That's it. Fill in that little bare spot right there. That's it. Isn't it wonderful about Harry? We're famous, George. I'll bet I had fifty calls today about the parade, the banquet. Your mother's so excited, she..."
10780,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Must she keep playing that?
10781,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Better hurry and shave. The families will be here soon.
10782,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Families! I don't want the families over here!
10783,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Come on out in the kitchen with me while I finish dinner.
10784,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Have a hectic day?
10785,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah, another big red letter day for the Baileys."
10786,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, what's the matter with our car? Isn't it good enough for you?"
10787,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Excuse you for what?
10788,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"All right, darling, you're excused. Now go upstairs and see what little Zuzu wants."
10789,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
10790,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat."
10791,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"What is it, a sore throat or what?"
10792,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
10793,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,The doctor? Was the doctor here?
10794,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about."
10795,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Is she running a temperature? What is it?
10796,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right."
10797,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Gosh, it's this old house. I don't know why we don't all have pneumonia. This drafty old barn! Might as well be living in a refrigerator. Why did we have to live here in the first place and stay around this measly, crummy old town?"
10798,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"George, what's wrong?"
10799,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Wrong? Everything's wrong! You call this a happy family? Why did we have to have all these kids?
10800,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I don't know. Ask your mother.
10801,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Where're you going?
10802,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Going up to see Zuzu.
10803,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,F-R-A-N-K-I-N...
10804,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, what happened to you?"
10805,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
10806,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink."
10807,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together."
10808,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"There it is, good as new."
10809,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Now, will you do something for me?"
10810,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Will you try to get some sleep?
10811,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I know  I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden."
10812,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Uh-huh.
10813,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"I'll get it. Hello. Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey."
10814,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch. I'm sure she'll be all right. The doctor says that she ought to be out of bed in time to have her Christmas dinner."
10815,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Is that Zuzu's teacher?
10816,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Yes.
10817,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Let me speak to her.
10818,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch? This is George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father. Say, what kind of a teacher are you anyway? What do you mean sending her home like that, halfnaked? Do you realize she'll probably end up with pneumonia on account of you?"
10819,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,George!
10820,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for  to have teachers like you? Silly, stupid, careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on? You know, maybe my kids aren't the best-dressed kids; maybe they don't have any decent clothes..."
10821,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Aw, that stupid..."
10822,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to apologize... hello... hello... She's hung up."
10823,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I'll hang her up!
10824,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Wait a minute. Hello? Who is this? Oh, Mr. Welch? Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch. Gives me a chance to tell you what I really think of your wife."
10825,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,George...
10826,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Will you get out and let me handle this? Hello? Hello? What? Oh, you will, huh? Okay, Mr. Welch, any time you think you're man enough... Hello? Any..."
10827,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Oh...
10828,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"How should I know? What do you think I am, a dictionary?"
10829,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Tommy, stop that! Stop it!"
10830,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Janie, haven't you learned that silly tune yet? You've played it over and over again. Now stop it! Stop it!"
10831,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I'm sorry, Mary, Janie. I'm sorry. I didn't mean... you go on and practice. Pete, I owe you an apology, too. I'm sorry. What do you want to know?"
10832,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"What's the matter with everybody? Janie, go on. I told you to practice. Now, go on, play!"
10833,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"George, why must you torture the children? Why don't you..."
10834,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Mary...
10835,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Bedford, two-four-seven, please."
10836,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Yes, Janie, pray very hard."
10837,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"You too, Tommy. Hello, Uncle Billy?"
10838,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter. I need help. Through some sort of an accident my company's short in their accounts. The bank examiner's up there today. I've got to raise eight thousand dollars immediately."
10839,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,The reporters?
10840,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Please help me, Mr. Potter. Help me, won't you please? Can't you see what it means to my family? I'll pay you any sort of a bonus on the loan... any interest. If you still want the Building and Loan, why I..."
10841,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"No, sir. There's nothing wrong with the books. I've just misplaced eight thousand dollars. I can't find it anywhere."
10842,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Yes, sir."
10843,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow..."
10844,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"No, sir. No, sir. I haven't."
10845,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,What?
10846,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
10847,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me."
10848,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"No, sir."
10849,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I have some life insurance, a fifteen thousand dollar policy."
10850,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Five hundred dollars.
10851,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"God... God... Dear Father in Heaven, I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear me, show me the way. I'm at the end of my rope. Show me the way, God."
10852,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Who was that?
10853,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
10854,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Where's my insurance policy? Oh, here..."
10855,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I'm all right.
10856,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I'm all right.
10857,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,You what? To save me?
10858,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Go through with what?
10859,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Very funny.
10860,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in answer to a prayer a little bit ago."
10861,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,How do you know my name?
10862,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"What are you, a mind reader or something?"
10863,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, who are you, then?"
10864,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Odbody... A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
10865,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, brother. I wonder what Martini put in those drinks?"
10866,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hey, what's with you? What did you say just a minute ago? Why'd you want to save me?"
10867,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
10868,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Yeah... just things like that. Now how'd you know that?
10869,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?"
10870,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
10871,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Sure, sure. How?"
10872,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
10873,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub."
10874,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
10875,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, everybody'd be a lot better off. My wife, and my kids and my friends. Look, little fellow, go off and haunt somebody else, will you?"
10876,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Aw, shut up, will you."
10877,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, I don't know. I guess you're right. I suppose it would have been better if I'd never been born at all."
10878,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I said I wish I'd never been born.
10879,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,What did you say?
10880,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Say something else in that ear.
10881,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, that's the doggonedest thing... I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water."
10882,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,What do you know about that... What's happened?
10883,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here? Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry..."
10884,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"What do you know about that? Stove's hotter than I thought. Now, come on, get your clothes on, and we'll stroll up to my car and get..."
10885,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly."
10886,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right."
10887,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, this is where I left my car and it isn't here."
10888,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it."
10889,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, say... Hey... where's my car?"
10890,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"My car, my car. I'm the fellow that owns the car that ran into your tree."
10891,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"What do you mean, what tree? This tree. Here, I ran into it. Cut a big gash in the side of it here."
10892,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Pottersville? Why, you mean Bedford Falls."
10893,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is... ...or you are!"
10894,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel."
10895,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Clarence! Clarence!
10896,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,That's all right. Go on in. Martini's a good friend of mine.
10897,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,There's a place to sit down. Sit down.
10898,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?"
10899,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?"
10900,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Okay  all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?"
10901,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Nick  Nick, just give him the same as mine. He's okay."
10902,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
10903,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?"
10904,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"You don't huh? Well, you got any money?"
10905,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,No wonder you jumped in the river.
10906,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, that's right."
10907,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Made what?
10908,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here."
10909,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"A... Yeah, but... you know..."
10910,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"He never grew up. He's... How old are you, anyway, Clarence?"
10911,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Look, Nick. What's wrong?"
10912,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?"
10913,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
10914,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hey, what is... Hey, Nick, Nick... Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?"
10915,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly..."
10916,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"What the... hey, what's going on around here? Why, this ought to be Martini's place."
10917,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Look, who are you?"
10918,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What... are you a hypnotist?"
10919,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?"
10920,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Then if I wasn't born, who am I?"
10921,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey."
10922,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,What?
10923,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Now wait a minute, here. Wait a minute here. As, this is some sort of a funny dream I'm having here. So long, mister, I'm going home."
10924,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Now shut up! Cut it out! You're... you're... you're crazy! That's what I think... you're screwy, and you're driving me crazy, too! I'm seeing things. I'm going home and see my wife and family. Do you understand that? And I'm going home alone!"
10925,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Hey... hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
10926,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
10927,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hey, Violet! Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!"
10928,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I know that girl!
10929,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hey, Ernie  Ernie!"
10930,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Ernie, take me home. I'm off my nut!"
10931,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up."
10932,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
10933,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Look here, Ernie, straighten me out here. I've got some bad liquor or something. Listen to me now. Now, you are Ernie Bishop, and you live in Bailey Park with your wife and kid? That's right, isn't it?"
10934,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Seen your wife? I've been to your house a hundred times.
10935,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
10936,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Of course it's the place.
10937,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Mary! Mary! Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu! Where are you?
10938,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Where are you? What have you done with them?
10939,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
10940,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?"
10941,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Bert  Ernie! What's the matter with you two guys? You were here on my wedding night. You, both of you, stood out here on the porch and sung to us, don't you remember?"
10942,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen! It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me."
10943,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Mother...
10944,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Mother, this is George. I thought sure you'd remember me."
10945,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it."
10946,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, I know everybody you know. Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy."
10947,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Well, sure I do."
10948,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Today, over at the house."
10949,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I've heard of things like this. You've got me in some kind of a spell, or something. Well, I'm going to get out of it. I'll get out of it. I know how, too. I... the last man I talked to before all this stuff started happening to me was Martini."
10950,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
10951,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?"
10952,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,That's a lie! Harry Bailey went to war! He got the Congressional Medal of Honor! He saved the lives of every man on that transport.
10953,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Clarence...
10954,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Where's Mary?
10955,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I don't know how you know these things, but tell me  where is she?"
10956,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is."
10957,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Please, Clarence, tell me where she is."
10958,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Where is she?
10959,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Where's Mary? Where is she?
10960,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Where is she?
10961,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Mary!
10962,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Mary!
10963,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Mary! Mary!
10964,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Mary, it's George! Don't you know me? What's happened to us?"
10965,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,I don't know you! Let me go!
10966,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to me. Please, Mary, help me. Where's our kids? I need you, Mary! Help me, Mary!"
10967,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Mary... Let me go! Mary, don't run away!"
10968,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,That man  stop him!
10969,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Tom! Ed! Charlie! That's my wife!
10970,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Mary!
10971,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Mary!
10972,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Clarence! Clarence! Where are you?
10973,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Clarence! Clarence! Help me, Clarence. Get me back. Get me back. I don't care what happens to me. Only get me back to my wife and kids. Help me, Clarence, please! Please! I want to live again!"
10974,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"I want to live again. I want to live again. Please, God, let me live again."
10975,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Now get out of here, Bert, or I'll hit you again! Get out!"
10976,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Don't... George?
10977,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Bert, do you know me?"
10978,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,What did...
10979,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"My mouth's bleeding, Bert! My mouth's bleed... Zuzu's petals! Zuzu's... they're... they're here, Bert! What do you know about that? Merry Christmas!"
10980,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Mary! Mary!
10981,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Hello, Bedford Falls!"
10982,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Merry Christmas!
10983,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Merry Christmas, movie house!"
10984,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Merry Christmas, emporium!"
10985,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Merry Christmas, you wonderful old Building and Loan!"
10986,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!"
10987,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Mary... Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner!"
10988,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I know. Eight thousand dollars.
10989,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest. Isn't it wonderful? Merry Christmas!
10990,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Reporters? Where's Mary? Mary!
10991,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Oh, look at this wonderful old drafty house! Mary! Mary!"
10992,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Have you seen my wife?
10993,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Kids!
10994,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Pete  kids  Janie  Tommy. I could eat you up!
10995,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Where's your mother?
10996,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Zuzu  Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
10997,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Not a smitch of temp...
10998,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Hello. George! Darling!
10999,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Mary! Mary!
11000,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"George, darling! Where have you been?"
11001,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Oh, George, George, George."
11002,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!"
11003,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Oh, George, George!"
11004,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,You have no idea what's happened to me.
11005,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,You have no idea what happened...
11006,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Well, come on, George, come on downstairs quick. They're on their way."
11007,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,All right.
11008,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Come on in here now. Now, you stand right over here, by the tree. Right there, and don't move, don't move. I hear 'em now, George, it's a miracle! It's a miracle!"
11009,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,"Come in, Uncle Billy! Everybody! In here!"
11010,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Violet Bick!
11011,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,Mr. Martini. How about some wine?
11012,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"Hello, George, how are you?"
11013,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,Harry... Harry...
11014,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,Mary  looks like I got here too late.
11015,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"Oh, I left right in the middle of it as soon as I got Mary's telegram."
11016,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,HARRY,"Good idea, Ernie. A toast... to my big brother, George. The richest man in town!"
11017,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,MARY,What's that?
11018,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,That's a Christmas present from a very dear friend of mine.
11019,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"That's right, that's right."
11020,Its-a-Wonderful-Life,GEORGE,"Attaboy, Clarence."
11021,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Right calcaneus of an adult female raptor. Mild stress fractures. What's this tell me?
11022,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,It tells me that this bone connects to the navicula which we already found articulating to the cuboid.
11023,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"So, what can we stay for sure? Stress fractures in the heel ..."
11024,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,She jumps.
11025,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Right as rain, Ellie. Now, why did she jump?"
11026,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"A defensive posture against a vicious, blood-thirsty T-Rex?"
11027,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Perhaps. Or maybe to select the smaller, more tender leaves in the higher branches with which to suckle her young?"
11028,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,I bet is was a mating ritual.
11029,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"The science of paleontology can't answer these questions. Novelists and artists who dream a vision of the Jurassic period can attempt these questions with their imaginations. What we scientists can say is considering the mass and kinetic articulation of these bones, this animal had a vertical leap of about twelve feet. Not as entertaining as fiction, but absolutely fact without prejudice."
11030,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"Excuse me, Dr. Grant. But ... fact is, we're late. There's the car."
11031,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Jim, you keep making up the plaster batches. Whatever ratio you're using, it's perfect. Nora, no digging after five - when the temperature drops, those bones are just too brittle. Bill, I don't want any tourists walking over my raptor - I don't care if the Governor of Montana is with them, just you guys."
11032,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"You know, if ev ery scientist stuck to his method like you, there would be no body of theory - no quasars, no big bang -"
11033,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Jesus, a limousine. We're re-entering Hammond's world, that's for sure. Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie."
11034,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,We're leaving the raptor dig -
11035,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,- at a critical time -
11036,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,- because Gennaro is paying us sixty thousand dollars to observe some resort of Hammond's in Costa Rica. And that's -
11037,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"- enough money to keep us free of commercial affiliations for two summers. All right, all right. Good."
11038,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Financial independence for fraternizing with the enemy? I'll do it.
11039,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"This is all could come up with, Skip?"
11040,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Wise guy. Let's go, Ellie."
11041,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,This is exciting!
11042,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"What is, Ellie? Where are we going?"
11043,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Looks like Alcatraz.
11044,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,How the hell is he landing this thing?
11045,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,This is not fun.
11046,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Relax, Ellie. I'm sure they wouldn't land if it weren't safe."
11047,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Gennaro? This guy knows what he's doing, Right? Hey, Gennaro? I'm talking to you!"
11048,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,I don't like this feeling ...
11049,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park?"
11050,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"Aggressive growth, huh?"
11051,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Hammond's trademark.
11052,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,I hope this isn't one of those animatronic exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting.
11053,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,The audicity of man to get here at the last second and think he runs the show.
11054,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,- the furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering.
11055,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Here we go.
11056,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"No, I don't mind popular science. I dislike the commercialization of science. It breeds a sloppiness, a disregard for method."
11057,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Mr. Hammond, the essential truth of a scientific law ha s nothing to do with public reaction. Water freezes at thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for it or not."
11058,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Just what is it you're trying to clone?
11059,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Who makes a windows ... smaller?
11060,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Don't worry - he'll grow out of it.
11061,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Dr. Grant's embarrassed that his book was so widely successful. He wrote if for gra duate students.
11062,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,What exactly do you mean ... biological attractions?
11063,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Yes?
11064,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,You created dinosaurs? Who gave you the right to do that?
11065,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,We don't have the science. There's no source of dinosaur DNA.
11066,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Who polices the computer?
11067,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Like mosquitos -
11068,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Mosquitos that sucked the blood of dinosaurs. That's your source of DNA
11069,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,It does?
11070,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"Put in a piece of amber, find a mosquito, drill it out. Right?"
11071,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't give you enough tissue to determine a complete DNA strand.
11072,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Okay, you have your ""complete"" DNA strand. How do you grow it?"
11073,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,And how do you know what it is you're growing?
11074,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,That's why you create the mist.
11075,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,What kind of eggs are these? Are these shells plastic?
11076,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,I'll tell you something that troubles me from the start. The carnivores are all well-fed and kept separated from their
11077,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,The carnivores will want to hunt. It's an instinct. And that instinct will have to be satisfied or suppressed.
11078,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Don't worry. Ellie makes her own judgments.
11079,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,I like to wait and see.
11080,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Ellie! Can you imagine the excavation team seeing this!
11081,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Alan? Alan? He fainted!
11082,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Ellie? What the hell are we going to do with the rest of our lives?
11083,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,What to you mean?
11084,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Can't you see it, Ellie? We're the ones that are extinct now."
11085,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,It's like a Gila monster of a cobra. It's a poison ...
11086,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Spitter!
11087,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Are we dreaming all this?
11088,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Poor girl. What's the matter? Ellie, look at this."
11089,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Microvesicles. Interesting.
11090,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,What does sh e eat? Where does she feed?
11091,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,West Indian Lilacs!
11092,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,These'd give anybody a stomachache.
11093,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Hey, Ellie take a look at his. Good work, Timmy."
11094,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"Extremely smooth. Purple stains, could be those lilac berries."
11095,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Looks like your trike swallows stones to help her digest her food. Walking around, she crushes berries against the stones. And even just a little crushed berry is eventually enough,"
11096,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"So, she poisons herself periodically."
11097,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"But with th e stones, she swallows them and probably bypasses any mucosal contact. Straight to the stomach. I would test her excrement."
11098,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,I'm staying.
11099,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Soil samples?
11100,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,You read my mind. I think she's sicker then they're saying. Her skin is dry and flaky. And her gums are pale. I'm going to talk to Dr. Wu.
11101,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Good idea. I'll keep my eyes open.
11102,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Where is the T- Rex?
11103,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs.
11104,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Then where is she?
11105,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,He's here.
11106,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"There'd be no stopping it. Huge, with no natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting instinct."
11107,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Is that still the T-Rex paddock?
11108,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"No! I'm going with you, Muldoon."
11109,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,What's the commotion?
11110,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Nedry? With an incubator? Regis??
11111,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right away. How far is it to the mainland?
11112,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running around Costa Rica.
11113,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Lot of track in college.
11114,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Timmy, be quiet. Don't move."
11115,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Don't move.
11116,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Shut that flashlight, Tim!"
11117,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Lex, are you okay?"
11118,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Let ... go ... please.
11119,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Timmy. Are you ok?
11120,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Below. She's fine. Let's get you down.
11121,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Try the door you're leaning against. Nice and slow.
11122,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Crawl this way. Slowly.
11123,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"We're going to have to make a jump for it, Timmy. Okay?"
11124,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"One, two, three, jump."
11125,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,You owe me one.
11126,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Where'd Lex go?
11127,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Come on out now, Lex."
11128,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there. And tight. Why don't you come out?"
11129,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"I'm a grownup, Lex. Come on out. Gimmie you hand, come on, here you go."
11130,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Me, too. We've got to get ourselves back to civilization."
11131,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"It's Regis and the Rex is after him. But it's okay. Regis knows the Rex can't see him. Evidently, he can only see move- ment. Regis'll be ok if he stays still."
11132,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Let's go!
11133,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"Oh, My God! Where's the other one?"
11134,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Then they must be out there. They must be out there. I know it.
11135,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,No! They're out there.
11136,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Looks like you've been through this before.
11137,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Right.
11138,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,I need to find Wu. I have to run a few tests in his lab.
11139,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Okay, Lex."
11140,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Oof! You're heavy.
11141,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,I think we're still in his paddock.
11142,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,What?
11143,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,What?
11144,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,No.
11145,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Okay with the fence, Timmy?"
11146,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,A herbivore grazing area. Excellent.
11147,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Twelve hours before that ship reaches the mainland.
11148,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Up there.
11149,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Sure you can.
11150,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,No sign of those berries. Really interesting. There are indications of a similar virus in every tissue sample. But it's not in the ground. Could I look at some of the discarded embryos?
11151,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"And yet from what Harding tells me, many of you animals have similar symptoms - besides the microvesicles, a lack of hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores in the mouth and gums."
11152,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"Why don't you get some sleep, Dr. Wu? I'm just going to run a couple more tests and then I'm going to turn in myself."
11153,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,I don't think so. She's a ...
11154,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Like the trike. Maybe it's not the stones.
11155,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Tim, I think there's a motion sensor across the field and down there."
11156,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Go home now. Home to Freda!
11157,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Go! Go away. Go! Get out of here!
11158,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,We gotta get to that motion detector. It's still a ways.
11159,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,I'm here to investigate this park. And there's plenty you haven't told me.
11160,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,These bones aren't fully formed.
11161,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"Right. What the hell is going on, Wu?"
11162,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"Gennaro's losing a lot of blood. He needs transfusions. We gotta get a rescue helicopter. Arnold, what's with the phones?"
11163,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Find what?
11164,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"Look, there is a sick man here who needs medical attention or he'll die. Four people are out there, missing in your park. We need search teams. We have to have a phone or radio."
11165,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Well?
11166,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,- turn the goddamn safety systems off! Can't you get it through your head that we have no choice?
11167,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,How long do we have to wait?
11168,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,What is it?
11169,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Come on.
11170,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,They're agitated.
11171,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Outta the way, kids! Run!"
11172,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,What's wrong?
11173,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Arnold! They're still not working.
11174,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,No we're not. Phones still dead.
11175,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,What's happening?
11176,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,What?
11177,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,We'll walk by the river. That leads back to the Visitor's center.
11178,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,You ready?
11179,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,What raft?
11180,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"It's still mid-morning. I bet we have at least ten miles to go. If we take the raft along the river, we can make much faster progress."
11181,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Lex, I don't see any raft."
11182,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Bullseye!
11183,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"No raft. Where did you see it, Lex?"
11184,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Assumed?
11185,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,I'm afraid there's no raft.
11186,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Looks pretty calm.
11187,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,No.
11188,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,There's a current.
11189,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,I'm not sl eeping... yet.
11190,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Guess I was wrong.
11191,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Hold on real tight.
11192,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,I'm trying. I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! ....
11193,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,No!!!!!
11194,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,You running on auxiliary power?
11195,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,I think they cut the power. Hey -
11196,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Well, there's our pot of gold. Let's go, kids."
11197,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Arnold's not with you?
11198,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Wait. What about Arnold?
11199,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Sorry, Tim. We gotta climb up."
11200,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"Hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur, you can't catch me. Hey, come and get me, you flat-snouted Mongolian beast. Hey!"
11201,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"I'm going in. Muldoon, cover the door after I go in. Wu, guide me!"
11202,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"Damn, I banged my head."
11203,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,One -
11204,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Two -
11205,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Three!
11206,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Raptor!
11207,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"Come on, Wu! Come on! Run!"
11208,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,They're coming inside!
11209,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Why didn't the power go on?
11210,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Probably your grandfather's quarters. Let's go.
11211,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Actually, stay here."
11212,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"No, keep an eye on things round here for me. I'll be back with the others."
11213,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"I'll radio the ship as soon as I find somebody. You're in charge now. Don't move from here ... unless you have to, ok?"
11214,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Be right back.
11215,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,Why don't you just nail that bastard?
11216,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,How long?
11217,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,There's a raptor on the roof of this building. Open that gate and you're a dead man.
11218,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Ellie, I'm go glad -"
11219,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"Shut up and listen. We have about fifteen minutes here. The computer has to be rebooted. That'll turn on the electric fences. Besides the r aptor stuck in here with us, there are four more ..."
11220,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Talk, Ellie, just keep talking."
11221,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Timmy, you know anything about computers?"
11222,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Ok good, you're elected."
11223,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Okay, we've reached the computer room. Who can te ll Timmy how to reboot?"
11224,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"Ah, Alan, nobody here knows how to boot the computer. Please hurry, we've only got a couple minutes left."
11225,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Tim, you got to book the system. They reset the power and there are no phones. We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta stop that ship."
11226,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,If we can get help very soon.
11227,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Ellie, we're working as fast as we can here."
11228,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"Ok, we're all right here for now."
11229,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Don't mention it. It was Timmy.
11230,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,But there's still one more raptor. So be careful.
11231,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Queen Anne, do you read me? Queen Anne?"
11232,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Report your position!
11233,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Try this for identification, Captain Farrell. You are in possession of stolen biological materials. If you don't turn that boat around and return to Isla Nublar immediately with your contraband cargo, you will be found in violation of Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act, you will be subject to revocation of license, penalties in excess of fifty thousand dollars, and five years in jail. Do you copy?"
11234,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Do you copy, Captain Farrell?"
11235,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Who the hell knows?
11236,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Well it gives us ten more hours. Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican Coast Guard on that thing.
11237,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,And then there were none.
11238,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,We have to leave now.
11239,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"You interrupted natural law. There are regulations, rules that nature follows that make her knowable."
11240,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Barriers? Like the seasons? The earth spinning, orbiting the sun? The entire solar system in interlocking motion. Our own beings in biological step with it all. Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the pattern and look what it's done!"
11241,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,Don't count on it. Now get in.
11242,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,You created mutant forms that you further mutated to create amus ement attractions. You made biological puppets with heartbeats and an early death sentence.
11243,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,You created a park to generate a profit- making merchandising operation.
11244,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,You park is doomed. Now come with me.
11245,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,"Come back, Mr. Hammond! It's over!"
11246,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,"They're so beautiful. They're condemned, aren't they? Even those embryo fragments had the same viral contamination."
11247,Jurassic-Park,GRANT,I have a theory.
11248,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,You have a theory?
11249,Jurassic-Park,ELLIE,So the very process itself was flawed.
11250,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Whu?
11251,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Uh, nothing!"
11252,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress! Rowrrrr...
11253,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Coming!
11254,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Sorry, Dad."
11255,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Oh, nothing. Just had a crazy dream."
11256,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Huh?
11257,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"What was I... eh, I was dreaming about uh... heh..."
11258,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Noodles.
11259,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Uh, yeah. What else would I be dreaming about?"
11260,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Careful, that soup is... sharp!"
11261,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Uh...a sign of what?
11262,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Dad Dad Dad, it was just a dream."
11263,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"But Dad, didn't you ever, I dunno, want to do something else? Something besides noodles?"
11264,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,So why didn't you?!
11265,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,I know. Is here.
11266,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Well done, students... if you were trying to disappoint me."
11267,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Tigress, you need more ferocity. Monkey, greater speed."
11268,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Crane - height. Viper - subtlety. Mantis--
11269,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,What?!
11270,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Master Oogway? You summoned me.
11271,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Is something wrong?
11272,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,So... nothing's wrong?
11273,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,You were saying?
11274,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,That is impossible. He is in prison.
11275,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Zeng!
11276,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Fly to Chogun Prison and tell them to double the guards, double their weapons. Double everything! Tai Lung does not leave that prison!"
11277,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"We have to do something. We can't just let him march on the valley, and take his revenge! He'll, he'll--"
11278,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,The Dragon Scroll...
11279,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,But who? Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power? To become...the Dragon Warrior?!
11280,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Oop...sorry.
11281,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Sorry. Suck it up.
11282,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Oop! Sorry! A thousand pardons.
11283,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,What?! Master Oogway's choosing the Dragon Warrior! Today!
11284,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Everyone! Everyone! Go! Get to the Jade Palace!
11285,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,One of the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!
11286,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,We've been waiting a thousand years for this! Just take the bowl!
11287,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"This is the greatest day in Kung Fu history! Don't worry about it, just go!"
11288,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,To the...Jade Palace?
11289,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Selling noodles? But Dad, you know, I was kinda thinking maybe I..."
11290,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,I was kinda thinking maybe I...
11291,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,...Could also sell the bean buns. They are about to go bad.
11292,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Yeah, ha ha, glad I had it."
11293,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Come on! Come on, ya-- Almost there..."
11294,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,What? No! Oh No!
11295,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.
11296,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"It is an historic day, isn't it, Master Oogway?"
11297,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Yes, Master Oogway."
11298,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Yeah!
11299,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Oh no! No no no! Wait! I'm coming!
11300,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Hey! Open the door!
11301,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Let me in!
11302,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Citizens of the Valley of Peace! It is my great honor to present to you... Tigress! Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis! The Furious Five!
11303,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,The Furious Five!
11304,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Warriors prepare!
11305,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Peeky-hole!
11306,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Ready for battle!
11307,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Yeah! Woo! The Thousand Tongues of Fire!
11308,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Hey, get out of the way!"
11309,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Ow...
11310,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,And finally...Master Tigress!
11311,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"And believe me citizens, you have not seen anything yet!"
11312,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,I KNOW!!
11313,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox and his Blades of Death!
11314,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Citizens of the Valley of Peace! Master Oogway will now choose... the Dragon Warrior!
11315,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Huh? Oh no! Wait!
11316,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Yeah!
11317,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,What does it look like I'm doing? Stop! Stop! I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!
11318,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"I lied. I don't dream about noodles, Dad!"
11319,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,I love kung fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-
11320,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Okay.
11321,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Uh oh...
11322,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,What's going on? Where...uh? What are you pointing--?
11323,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Oh. Okay. Sorry. I just wanted to see who the Dragon Warrior was.
11324,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Who--?
11325,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Me?
11326,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,What?
11327,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,What???
11328,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Stop! Wait! Who told you to--?
11329,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Master Oogway, wait! That flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to... our problem. You were about to point at Tigress. That thing fell in front of her. That was just an accident!"
11330,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"No. If the panda has not quit by morning, then I will have failed you."
11331,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Wait a second! Hello? Uh...I think there's been a slight mistake. Everyone seems to think that I'm, uh..."
11332,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Whoa. The Sacred Hall of Warriors. No way! Would you look at this place!
11333,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Master Flying Rhino's Armor! With authentic battle damage!
11334,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,The Sword of Heroes! Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking-- OW!
11335,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,The Invisible Trident of Destiny!?
11336,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,I've only seen paintings of that painting...
11337,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Nooo! Ohhhh!
11338,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,The legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors! Said to contain the souls of the entire Tenshu army. Hellooo?
11339,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Have you finished sight-seeing?
11340,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Sorry. I should've come to see you first.
11341,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,My patience is wearing thin.
11342,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Oh. Well, I mean, it's not like you were going anywhere."
11343,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Would you turn around?
11344,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Sure.
11345,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Hey, how's it going?"
11346,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Now how do you get five thousand-- Master Shifu!
11347,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Someone...broke that. But I'm gonna fix it. Do you have some glue?
11348,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Ow! Ooh. Splinter.
11349,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior. Hmmm?
11350,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Uh...I guess so?
11351,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Wrong! You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will never be the Dragon Warrior until you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll.
11352,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Whoa. So how does this work? You have a ladder or trampoline or...?
11353,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,You think it's that easy? That I am just going to hand you the secret to limitless power?
11354,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"No, I..."
11355,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,One must first master the highest level of kung fu. And that is clearly impossible if that one is someone like you.
11356,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Someone like me?
11357,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Yes. Look at you...this fat butt.
11358,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Flabby arms...
11359,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.
11360,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,And this ridiculous belly.
11361,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Hey...
11362,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,--and utter disregard for personal hygiene.
11363,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Now wait a minute. That's a little uncalled-for.
11364,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Don't stand that close...I can smell your breath.
11365,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Listen...Oogway said that I was the-
11366,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,The Wuxi Finger Hold?! Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!
11367,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Oh, you know this hold?"
11368,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,DevelopedbyMasterWuxiInTheThirdDyna sty-- YES.
11369,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Oh, then you must know what happens when I flex my pinky."
11370,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,No no no!
11371,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,You know the hardest part of this? The hardest part is cleaning up afterwards...
11372,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Okay! Okay! Take it easy...
11373,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Now listen closely, panda. Oogway may have picked you, but when I'm through with you, I promise you, you're going to wish he hadn't. Are we clear?"
11374,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Yeah, we're clear. We're clear. We are so clear."
11375,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Good. I can't wait to get started.
11376,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Let's begin.
11377,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Wait wait wait...What? Now?
11378,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Yes...now. Unless you think the great Oogway was wrong, and you are not the Dragon Warrior."
11379,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Oh, okay. Well-- I don't know if I can do all of those moves."
11380,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Well, if we don't try, we'll never know will we?"
11381,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Uh, yeah. It's just, maybe we can find something more suited to my level."
11382,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,And what level is that?
11383,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Well, ya know...I'm not a master, but uh, let's just start at zero, level zero."
11384,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,There is no such thing as level zero.
11385,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Hey! Maybe I can start with that.
11386,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,That? We use that for training children. And for propping the door open when it's hot. But if you insist...
11387,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Whoa. The Furious Five. You're so much bigger than your action figures -- except for you, Mantis. You're about the same."
11388,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Go ahead, panda. Show us what you can do."
11389,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Um, are they gonna watch? Or should I just wait until they get back to work or something..."
11390,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Hit it.
11391,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Ok. I mean, I just ate. So I'm still digesting... So my kung fu might not be as good as later on."
11392,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Just hit it.
11393,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Alright. Whatcha got? You got nothing cause I got it right here. You picking on my friends? Get ready to feel the thunder. I'm comin' at him with the crazy feet. Whatcha gonna do about my crazy feet? I'm a blur. I'm a blur. You never seen bear style, you only seen praying Mantis! OR... I could come at you Monkey style. OR... I'm comin' at ya snikity-snake."
11394,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Would you hit it!
11395,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Alright...alright.
11396,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Why don't you try again? A little harder...
11397,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,How's tha--
11398,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Ow, that hurts."
11399,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,This'll be easier than I thought.
11400,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Feeling a little nauseous.
11401,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Ow, those are hard! Ooh! I think I..."
11402,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Oooohoohoo...my tenders.
11403,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,How did I do?
11404,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,There is now a level zero.
11405,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Okay.
11406,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Great.
11407,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Oh hey...hi. You're up.
11408,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"I was just uh... Some day huh? That kung fu stuff is hard work, right? Your biceps sore?"
11409,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Yeah yeah yeah, of course."
11410,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,It's just...I'm such a big fan.
11411,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"You guys were totally amazing at the Battle of Weeping River. Outnumbered a thousand to one, but you didn't stop, and then you just... HI-YAH!"
11412,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Ooo, sorry about that."
11413,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,I know. I know. You're right. I just - my whole life I've dreamed of-
11414,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Oh, okay. Right right. Yeah, you want to get to sleep."
11415,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,I'm keepin' you up. We got big things tomorrow. Alright. You're awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say. Okay. Bye bye.
11416,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,What was that?
11417,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Okay. Alright. Goodnight. Sleep well.
11418,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Seemed a little bit awkward.
11419,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Master Tigress! Didn't mean to wake you. Just uh...
11420,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Uh, yeah, yeah. Of course. This is your room."
11421,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Big fan...
11422,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Is that what this is? I am so sorry. I thought it was just a regular peach tree.
11423,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Upset? I'm not upset. What makes you think I'm upset?
11424,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"I probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu, in the history of China, in the history of sucking."
11425,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"And the Five... man, you should have seen them, they totally hate me."
11426,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"How's Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior? I mean, I'm not like The Five. I've got no claws, no wings, no venom. Even Mantis has those... ...thingies. Maybe I should just quit and go back to making noodles."
11427,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Panda! Panda, wake up!"
11428,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Hmm. He's quit.
11429,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"All we can do is resume our training and trust that in time, the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed."
11430,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,What are you doing here?!
11431,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Hey! Huh... Good morning, Master! I thought I'd warm up a little."
11432,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,You're stuck.
11433,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Stuck?! Whaa? Pfft... stuck... Yeah, I'm stuck."
11434,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Help him.
11435,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Maybe on three. One. Two-
11436,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Threeeee. Thank you.
11437,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"No really, I appreci--"
11438,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,You actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night? It takes years to develop one's flexibility and years longer to apply it in combat.
11439,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Put that down! The only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones.
11440,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Yeah, excellent!"
11441,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Let's get started.
11442,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,I was born ready--
11443,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Eaghhh...
11444,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,That was awesome! Let's go again.
11445,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"I've been taking it easy on you, panda, but no more! Your next opponent... will be me."
11446,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Alright! Let's go!
11447,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Step forth.
11448,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,The true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness and make him suffer for it.
11449,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Oh, yeah!"
11450,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,To take his strength and use it against him.
11451,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"--until he finally falls, or quits."
11452,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"But a real warrior never quits. Don't worry, Master, I will never quit!"
11453,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Aaaoo...whoohoo...EEEee...hee- hee... I thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better.
11454,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Fat?
11455,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Sure you were.
11456,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Ow!
11457,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Ow! Don't... Stop it, stop-- Yow! I know Master Shifu's trying to inspire me and all, but if I didn't know any better, I'd say he was trying to get rid of me."
11458,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,No.
11459,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Before what?
11460,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Guys, guys. I know about Tai Lung."
11461,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"He was a student, the first ever to master the thousand..."
11462,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,...scrolls of... kung fu... and... then he turned bad... and now he's in jail.
11463,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Doieeeee...
11464,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.
11465,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Would whoever is making that flapping sound, quiet down!"
11466,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Inner...
11467,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Oh, Zeng. Excellent. I could use some good news right now."
11468,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Master! Master!
11469,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,I have-- it's-- it's very bad news.
11470,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Master, your vision...your vision was right. Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way!"
11471,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"The panda? Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior."
11472,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,He wasn't even meant to be here -- it was an accident!
11473,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Yes, I know. You've said that already. Twice."
11474,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Thrice.
11475,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Illusion?
11476,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,But there are things we can control.
11477,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,I can control when the fruit will fall.
11478,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,And I can control--
11479,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"--where to plant the seed. That is no illusion, Master."
11480,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!
11481,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"But how? How? I need your help, Master."
11482,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,I... I will try.
11483,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,What... what are you..?
11484,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Master, you can't leave me!"
11485,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Master!
11486,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"...So I'm like, fine, you may be a wolf, you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province..."
11487,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,...but you're a lousy tipper.
11488,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"I mean, I didn't actually say that, but I thought it... in my mind."
11489,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"If he... could read my mind, he'd have been like, ""What?"" Order up!"
11490,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Hope you like it.
11491,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"No, c'mon."
11492,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,You should try my dad's secret ingredient soup. He actually knows the secret ingredient.
11493,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet. I'm gonna need a lot more than dew. And, uh, universe juice."
11494,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,What?
11495,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"You will never be the Dragon Warrior, unless you lose five hundred pounds and brush your teeth!"
11496,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,What is that noise you're making? Laughter? I never heard of it!
11497,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Work hard, Panda. And maybe, someday... you will have ears like mine."
11498,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Ears. It's not working for you? I thought they were pretty good.
11499,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Of course it's Shifu. What do you think I'm doing?
11500,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Ooh! Master Shifu!
11501,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,You think this is funny? Tai Lung has escaped from prison and you're acting like children!
11502,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,What?
11503,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"He is coming for the Dragon Scroll, and you are the only one who can stop him."
11504,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,And here I am saying you got no sense of humor. I'm gonna stop Tai...
11505,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"What? You're serious? And I have to-- uh, Master Oogway will stop him! He did it before, he'll do it again."
11506,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Oogway cannot, not anymore."
11507,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.
11508,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Yes, the panda!"
11509,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,No! It is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung. It is his.
11510,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Where'd he go?
11511,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,You cannot leave! A real warrior never quits!
11512,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Watch me!
11513,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Come on! How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung? I can't even beat you to the stairs.
11514,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,You will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior!
11515,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Ow! You don't believe that! You never believed that! From the first moment I got here, you've been trying to get rid of me."
11516,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Yes. I was. But now I ask you to trust in your master as I have come to trust in mine.
11517,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,You're not my master. And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
11518,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Then why didn't you quit? You knew I was trying to get rid of you, and yet you stayed."
11519,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Yeah, I stayed. I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said I smelled, it hurt. But it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me."
11520,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"I stayed because I thought if anyone could change me, could make me... not me, it was you. The greatest kung fu teacher in all of China."
11521,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,But I can change you! I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior! And I will!
11522,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"C'mon, Tai Lung is on his way here right now. And even if it takes him a hundred years to get here, how are you gonna change this... ...into the Dragon Warrior? How? How? How?!"
11523,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,I don't know!!! I don't know.
11524,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,That's what I thought.
11525,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"What? I eat when I'm upset, okay?"
11526,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Oh, no need to explain. I just thought you might be Monkey -- he hides his almond cookies on the top shelf."
11527,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Don't tell Monkey.
11528,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Look at you.
11529,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Yeah, I know. I disgust you."
11530,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"No no, I mean... how did you get up there?"
11531,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,I don't know. I guess I-- I don't know. I was getting a cookie...
11532,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,And yet you are ten feet off the ground and have done a perfect split.
11533,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"No, this... this is just an accident."
11534,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,There are no accidents. Come with me.
11535,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"I know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fu-y, but could you at least tell me where we're going?"
11536,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,You dragged me all the way out here for a bath?!
11537,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Panda, we do not wash our pits in The Pool of Sacred Tears."
11538,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,The pool of...
11539,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,This is where Oogway unravelled the mysteries of harmony and focus. This is the birthplace of Kung Fu.
11540,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Do you want to learn Kung Fu?
11541,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Yeah...
11542,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Then I am your master!
11543,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Okay!
11544,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Don't cry.
11545,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Okay.
11546,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"When you focus on Kung Fu, when you concentrate...you stink."
11547,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,But perhaps that is my fault. I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five. I now see that the way to get through to you is with this!
11548,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Oh great, `cause I'm hungry."
11549,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Good. When you have been trained, you may eat. Let us begin."
11550,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"After you, panda."
11551,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Just like that? No situps? No ten mile hike?
11552,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,I vowed to train you... and you have been trained. You are free to eat.
11553,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Enjoy.
11554,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Hey!
11555,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,I said you are free to eat. Have a dumpling.
11556,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Hey!
11557,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,You are free to eat!
11558,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Am I?
11559,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Are you?!
11560,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,I'm not hungry... master.
11561,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"You have done well, Panda."
11562,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Done well? Done well?! I've done awesome!
11563,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,The mark of a true hero is humility!
11564,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,But yes...you have done awesome.
11565,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Huh? Guys? Guys!
11566,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"They're dead? No, they're breathing! They're asleep?! No, their eyes are open."
11567,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,He has gotten stronger.
11568,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?
11569,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,He could have killed you.
11570,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,So you could come back here and strike fear into our hearts. But it won't work!
11571,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Uh, it might, I mean, a little. I'm pretty scared."
11572,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"You can defeat him, panda."
11573,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Are you kidding? If they can't-- They're five masters. I'm just one me.
11574,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,But you will have the one thing that no one else does.
11575,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,You really believe I'm ready?
11576,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"You are, Po."
11577,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Behold. The Dragon Scroll... It is yours.
11578,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Wait, what happens when I read it?"
11579,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"No one knows, but legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing-beat."
11580,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Whoa! Really? That's cool.
11581,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Yes. And see light in the deepest cave. You will feel the universe in motion around you.
11582,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Wow! Can I punch through walls? Can I do a quadruple back flip? Will I have invisibility--
11583,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Focus. Focus.
11584,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Huh? Oh, yeah... yeah."
11585,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny. Read it and become... the Dragon Warrior!"
11586,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Whooaa!!!
11587,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,It's impossible to open.
11588,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Come on baby. Come on now...
11589,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Thank you. I probably loosened it up for you though... Okay, here goes."
11590,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
11591,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,It's blank!
11592,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,What?
11593,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Here! Look!
11594,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,No! I am forbidden to look upon--
11595,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Blank? I don't...I don't understand.
11596,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Okay. So like, Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all?"
11597,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,No. Oogway was wiser than us all.
11598,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Oh, come on! Face it. He picked me by accident. Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?"
11599,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"No, evacuate the Valley. You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage."
11600,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,I will fight him.
11601,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,What?
11602,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,I can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape.
11603,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"But Shifu, he'll kill you."
11604,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Then I will finally have paid for my mistake.
11605,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Listen to me, all of you. It is time for you to continue your journey without me. I am very proud to have been your master."
11606,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Hey, Dad."
11607,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Good to be back.
11608,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"I don't know, Dad. Honestly, sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son."
11609,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Okay.
11610,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Oh.
11611,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Huh?
11612,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Wait wait...it's just plain old noodle soup? You don't add some kind of special sauce or something?
11613,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,There is no secret ingredient...
11614,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,This is no longer your home. And I am no longer your master.
11615,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,This battle is between you and me.
11616,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,That is how it must be.
11617,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Obeying your master is not weakness!
11618,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior! That was not my fault!
11619,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,It was never my decision to make!
11620,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,I would rather die.
11621,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"I have always been proud of you. From the first moment, I've been proud of you. And it was my pride that blinded me. I loved you too much to see what you were becoming. What I was turning you into. I'm... sorry."
11622,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Dragon Warrior has taken scroll halfway across China by now. You will never see that scroll, Tai Lung. Never. Never..."
11623,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Hey!
11624,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Stairs...
11625,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior. Huhhh..."
11626,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Don't tempt me. Haha. No. I'm gonna use this. You want it? Come and get it.
11627,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Lightning!
11628,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,It's okay. I didn't get it the first time either.
11629,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,There is no secret ingredient. It's just you.
11630,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,AAAAGGGHH!
11631,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Stop! Stop it! I'm gonna pee! Don't! Don't!
11632,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"I'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the big, fat panda."
11633,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Oh, you know this hold?"
11634,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Nope. I figured it out.
11635,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Skadoosh!
11636,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Thanks, Dad."
11637,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Hey, guys."
11638,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Master? Master Shifu!
11639,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?
11640,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Po! You're alive! Or we're both dead.
11641,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"No, Master, I didn't die. I defeated Tai Lung!"
11642,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,You did?!
11643,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"Wow. It is as Oogway foretold -- You are the Dragon Warrior. You have brought peace to this Valley. And to me. Thank you. Thank you, Po. Thank you..."
11644,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"No! Master! No No No! Don't die, Shifu. Please..."
11645,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,"I'm not dying, you idiot-- ah, Dragon Warrior. I'm simply at peace. Finally."
11646,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,"Oh. So, um, I should...stop talking?"
11647,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,If you can.
11648,Kung-Fu-Panda,PO,Want to get something to eat?
11649,Kung-Fu-Panda,SHIFU,Yeah.
11650,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Yes. It means I'm free.
11651,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,I stole a loaf of bread My sister's child was close to death And we were starving.
11652,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,I know the meaning of those nineteen years A slave of the law!
11653,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,My name is Jean Valjean!
11654,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Freedom at last - How strange the taste! Never forget the years - the waste, Nor forgive them for what they've done. They are the guilty - Everyone! The day begins"
11655,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Monsieur can I help? A day's work?
11656,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Jailer. Would you let me stay here for tonight?
11657,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Pontarlier.
11658,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,No. The destination is compulsory. That is where the Law sends me. I have no home.
11659,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,You let me sleep here next to you? How do you know I'm not a murderer?
11660,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"What have I done? Sweet Jesus, what have I done? Become a thief in the night Become a dog on the run! And have I fallen so far And is the hour so late That nothing remains but the cry of my hate? The cries in the dark that nobody hears Here where I stand at the turning of the years."
11661,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"I am reaching, but I fall And the night is closing in... As I stare into the void - To the whirlpool of my sin."
11662,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,I'll escape now from that world - From the world of Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean is nothing now!
11663,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Another story must begin!
11664,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"What is this fighting all about? Will someone tear these two apart? This is a factory, not a circus."
11665,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Now come on, ladies, settle down. I run a business of repute."
11666,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Deal with this, Foreman. Be as patient as you can."
11667,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Welcome, sir Come guard our laws I'm sure we're here In common cause."
11668,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,The dignity of toil To stay alive.
11669,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Your face is not a face I would forget.
11670,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Get back! It may fall!
11671,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Say what you must. Don't leave it there.
11672,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Let me help you up.
11673,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,No more cart driving for you!
11674,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"A moment of your time, Javert. I do believe this woman's tale."
11675,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"You've done your duty. Let her be. She needs a doctor, not a jail."
11676,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Where will she end - This child without a friend?
11677,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,I've seen your face before. Show me some way to help you. How have you come to grief In such a place as this?
11678,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Is it true what I've done -
11679,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,- to an innocent soul?
11680,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Had I only known then!
11681,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,In His name my task has just begun. I will her to the hospital.
11682,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Where is she?
11683,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,I will see it done! I will send for her immediately!
11684,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"I don't understand. What is this crime, Javert?"
11685,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"You say this man denies it all, And gives no sign of understanding or repentance? You say this man is going to trial, And that he's sure to be returned to serve his sentence?"
11686,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"You have only done your duty It's a minor sin at most. All of us have been mistaken You'll return, sir, to your post."
11687,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,It's your duty to obey!
11688,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,They think that man is me - Without a second glance. This stranger they have found - This man could be my chance!
11689,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,I am the master of hundreds of workers - They all look to me. Can I abandon them? How would they live If I am not free?
11690,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Can I conceal myself for ever more? Pretend I'm not the man I was before? And must my name until I die Be no more than an alibi?
11691,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"My soul belongs to God, I know, I made that bargain long ago. He gave me hope when hope was gone! He gave me strength to journey on! Who am I? Who am I? I'm Jean Valjean!"
11692,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"And so, your honour, you see it's true That man bears no more guilt than you! Who am I? 24601!"
11693,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,If you don't believe me ask Inspector Javert. He knows where to find me.
11694,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Is her daughter with her?
11695,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,`Money not enough. Send more. Thenardier.' What sort of man is this?
11696,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Dear Fantine, Cosette will be here soon! Dear Fantine, she will be by your side"
11697,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Be at peace! Be at peace ever more.
11698,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,- shall live in my protection.
11699,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Your child will want for nothing.
11700,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,And none shall ever harm Cosette as long as I am living.
11701,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Then I will keep you warm.
11702,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Take shelter from the storm.
11703,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Before you say another word, Javert, Before you chain me up like a slave again, Listen to me! There is something I must do. This woman leaves behind a suffering child. There is none but me who can intercede - In mercy's name, three days are all I need, Then I'll return, I pledge my word! Then I'll return..."
11704,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Believe of me what you will There is a duty that I'm sworn to do. You know nothing of my life - All I did was steal some bread. You know nothing of the world - You would sooner see me dead. But not before I see this justice done!
11705,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"I am warning you, Javert, I'm a stronger man by far! There is power in me yet! My race is not yet run!"
11706,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,And this I swear to you tonight -
11707,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Your child will live within my care -
11708,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,And I will raise her to the light.
11709,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Hush now, do not be afraid of me. Don't cry. Show me where you live."
11710,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Cosette?
11711,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"I found her wandering in the wood This little child, I found her trembling in the shadows. And I am here to help Cosette, And I will settle any debt you may think proper. I will pay what I must pay To take Cosette away."
11712,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Cosette shall live in my protection.
11713,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,I will not forget my vow.
11714,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Cosette shall have a father now.
11715,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Your feelings do you credit, sir. And I will ease the parting blow. Let us not talk of bargains and bones and greed."
11716,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Now may I say we are agreed?
11717,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"No more! Here's your price! Fifteen hundred for your sacrifice. Come, Cosette, say goodbye. Let's seek out some friendlier sky. Thank you both for Cosette - It won't take you too long to forget."
11718,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Where I go, you will be."
11719,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Yes, Cosette! This is true! I'll be father and mother to you!"
11720,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Suddenly I see Suddenly it starts When two anxious hearts Beat as one. Yesterday I was alone Today you walk beside me Something still unclear Something not yet here Has begun. Suddenly the world Seems a different place Somehow full of grace
11721,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Who are you?
11722,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Monsieur Fauchelevent!
11723,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Now you can do the same for me. We need a place of sanctuary. This child and I, we need to disappear."
11724,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,We'll give thanks for what is granted What the sisters may ordain Here we pray for new beginnings - Here our lives can start again.
11725,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"What is this? Are you mad? No, Monsieur, you don't know what you say!"
11726,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Dear Cosette, You're such a lonely child. How pensive, how sad you seem to me. Believe me, were it within my power I'd fill each passing hour. How quiet it must be, I can see, With only me for company."
11727,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"No more words - No more words. It's a time that is dead. There are words That are better unheard, Better unsaid."
11728,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"You will learn. Truth is given by God To us all in our time, In our turn."
11729,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Cosette! Cosette!
11730,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"My God, Cosette! I heard a cry in the dark. I heard the shout of angry voices in the street."
11731,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,This is a warning to us all! These are the shadows of the past!
11732,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Must be Javert. He's found my cover at last. I've got to get Cosette away Before he returns.
11733,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,We must get away from shadows That will never let us be. Tonight we leave Cosette!
11734,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Rue de L'Homme Armee.
11735,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,And then a ship across the sea.
11736,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Hurry, Cosette! Prepare to leave, And say no more. Tonight we'll away!"
11737,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Hurry, Cosette! It's time to close another door And live another day!"
11738,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"One day more! Another day, another destiny. This never-ending road to Calvary. These men who seem to know my crime Will surely come a second time - One day more!"
11739,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,One day more!
11740,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,One day more!
11741,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,One day more!
11742,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Tomorrow we'll be far away.
11743,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,I'll take it.
11744,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"`Dearest Cosette, you have entered my soul And soon you will be gone. Can it be only a day since we met And the world was reborn? If I should fall in the battle to come Let this be my goodbye. Now that I know you love me as well It is harder to die. I pray that God will bring me home To be with you. Pray for your Marius. He prays for you.'"
11745,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"They haven't got a chance, these boys They almost certainly will die She'll be alone And she will need me all the more And we will go on as before When he is gone I dare not think like this I must find this boy"
11746,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Don't shoot!
11747,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,I come here as a volunteer.
11748,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,That's why they let me through.
11749,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,There's much that I can do.
11750,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Give me no thanks, M'sieur. There's something you can do."
11751,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Give me the spy Javert! Let me take care of him.
11752,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,We meet again...
11753,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,You talk too much. Your life is safe in my hands.
11754,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Get out of here.
11755,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Clear out of here!
11756,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"You are wrong, and always have been wrong. I'm a man no worse than any man. You are free, and there are no conditions - No bargains or petitions. There's nothing that I blame you for. You've done your duty, nothing more. No doubt our paths will cross again."
11757,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Go!
11758,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,God on high Hear my prayer
11759,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Let me go! He's no more than a boy. I am old. I have nothing to fear.
11760,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,How do I get out of here?
11761,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"It's you, Javert! I knew you wouldn't wait too long. The faithful servant at his post once more. This man's done no wrong. And he needs his family's care."
11762,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Another hour yet And then I'm yours And all our debts are paid.
11763,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Come, time is running short - Look down, Javert! He's standing in his grave!"
11764,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Then I die.
11765,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"She was never mine to keep She is youthful, she is free..."
11766,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Not another word, my son. There's something now that must be done..."
11767,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,There lived a man whose name was Jean Valjean. He stole some bread to save his sister's son For nineteen winters served his time In sweat he washed away his crime.
11768,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Years ago, He broke parole and lived a life apart... How could he tell Cosette and break her heart? It's for Cosette this must be faced: If he is caught, she is disgraced... The time has come to journey on, And from this day he must be gone! Who am I? Who am I?"
11769,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Make her believe I have gone on a journey A long way away. Tell her my heart was too full for farewells - It is better this way. Promise me, Monsieur, Cosette will never know..."
11770,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"...What I have spoken, why I must go."
11771,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Alone I wait in the shadows I count the hours till I can sleep. I dreamed a dream Cosette stood by It made her weep To know I die... Alone at the end of the day Upon this wedding night I pray Take these children, my Lord, to thy embrace And show them grace... God on high Hear my prayer Take me now To thy care Where you are Let me be Take me now Take me there Bring me home Bring me home!"
11772,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"I am ready, Fantine..."
11773,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,At the end of my days...
11774,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,She's the best of my life...
11775,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Cosette?
11776,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Cosette, my child! Am I forgiven now? Thank God, thank God, I've lived to see this day!"
11777,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Now you are here Again beside me Now I can die in peace For now my life is blessed...
11778,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die! I'll obey I will try..."
11779,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,On this page I write my last confession. Read it well When I at last am sleeping. It's the story Of one who turned from hating A man who only learned to love When you were in his keeping.
11780,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,"I'm ready now, Fantine."
11781,Les-Miserables,VALJEAN,Forgive me all my trespasses And take me to your glory!
11782,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,You're late.
11783,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to."
11784,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!"
11785,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?
11786,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,What news of the outside world? Tell me everything!
11787,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"What, everything? Far too eager and curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural..."
11788,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Well, what can I tell you? Life in the wide world goes on much as if it has past age. Full of its own comings and goings, scarcely even aware of the existence of Hobbits..."
11789,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,...for which I am very thankful.
11790,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Ah, the long expected party. So, how is the old rascal? I hear it's going to be a Party of Special Magnificence."
11791,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,You know Bilbo...he's got he whole place in an uproar.
11792,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Oh, well...that should please him."
11793,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Half the Shire's been invited...
11794,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Good gracious, me."
11795,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,He's up to something.
11796,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Oh, really?"
11797,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Alright then..keep your secrets. Before you came along we Bagginses were very well thought of.
11798,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Indeed?
11799,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.
11800,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,If you're referring to the incident with the Dragon...I was barely involved...all I did was give your Uncle a little nudge out the door.
11801,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Whatever you did...you've been officially labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.
11802,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Oh, really?"
11803,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Gandalf... I'm glad you're back. Frodo leaps expertly from the cart. Gandalf smiles.
11804,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"So am I, dear boy...so am I"
11805,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,And what about very old friends?
11806,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Bilbo Baggins!
11807,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"It's good to see you. One hundred and eleven years old, who would believe it!"
11808,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,You haven't aged a day! Gandalf and Bilbo laugh together and enter Bag End.
11809,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Just tea, thank you."
11810,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud knock on the front door."
11811,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"So, you mean to go through with your plan, then?"
11812,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Frodo suspects something.
11813,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"You will tell him, won't you?"
11814,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,He's very fond of you.
11815,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance."
11816,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,I think I'll just have myself another ale.
11817,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"Oh, no you don't. Go on."
11818,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Bilbo! Watch out for the dragon!!
11819,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Meridoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took...I might have known!
11820,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Speech!
11821,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,I suppose you think that was terribly clever?
11822,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"There are many magic rings in the world, Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be used lightly."
11823,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?"
11824,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,What about this ring of yours? Is that staying too?
11825,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"I think you should leave the Ring behind, Bilbo. Is that so hard?"
11826,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,There's no need to get angry.
11827,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Precious? It's been called that before, but not by you."
11828,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,I think you've had that ring quite long enough.
11829,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a frightened Hobbit. Gandalf's expression softens."
11830,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"I am not trying to rob you. I am trying to help you. Sobbing, Bilbo runs to Gandalf and hugs him."
11831,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,All you long years we've been friends...trust me as you once did. Let it go!
11832,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Bilbo?
11833,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,The ring is still in your pocket.
11834,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"I'm sure you will, my dear friend."
11835,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Goodbye Bilbo.
11836,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Until our next meeting.
11837,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Riddles in the dark.
11838,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Bilbo! Bilbo!
11839,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,My precious...precious..
11840,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"He's gone, hasn't he? Frodo steps into the living room."
11841,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,He talked for so long about leaving...I didn't think he'd really do it.
11842,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,...my own.
11843,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Gandalf?
11844,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Bilbo's ring.
11845,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,He's gone to stay with the Elves. He's left you Bag End...
11846,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,...along with all his possessions.
11847,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,The ring is yours now. But it somewhere out of sight. Gandalf rises hurriedly and starts to gather his things.
11848,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Where are you going?
11849,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,I have some things I must see to.
11850,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,What things?
11851,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Questions. Questions that need answering.
11852,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,You've only just arrived! I don't understand...
11853,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it safe."
11854,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"The year 3434 of the Second Age...here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor, and the finding of the ring of power."
11855,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,It has come to me...the ring of power!
11856,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"It shall be an heirloom of my Kingdom...all those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate, for I will risk no hurt to the"
11857,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"ring...it is precious to me, though I buy it with great pain..."
11858,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"The marking upon the band begin to fade...the writing which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared...a secret now that only fire can tell..."
11859,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Is it secret? Is it safe?
11860,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,What are you doing?
11861,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Hold out your hand, Frodo...it is quite cool."
11862,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,What can you see? Can you see anything?
11863,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Nothing...there's nothing. Wait...
11864,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,...these are markings.
11865,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,It's some form of Elvish...I can't read it.
11866,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"There are few who can...the language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here."
11867,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,GANDALF
11868,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"This is the one ring forged by the dark lord, Sauron, in the fires of Mt Doom...taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself."
11869,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Bilbo found it...in Gollom's cave.
11870,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"For sixty years the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life, delaying old age...but no longer, Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has awoken. It has heard its master's call."
11871,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"AT THAT MOMENT: A FLEETING, LOW WHISPER of BLACK SPEECH"
11872,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,But he was destroyed...Sauron was destroyed.
11873,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron has endured. His life force is bound to the ring and the ring survived. Sauron has returned. His Orcs have multiplied...his fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this ring to cover all the lands in the second darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it, all his thought is bent on it. For the ring yearns, above all else, to return to the hand of its master: they are one, the ring and the dark lord. Frodo, he must never find out. SUDDENLY Frodo scoops up the Ring."
11874,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Alright!
11875,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"We put it away, we keep it hidden! We never speak of it again. No one know it's here, do they? Gandalf shifts uncomfortably."
11876,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"Do they, Gandalf?"
11877,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring. I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum, but the enemy found him first."
11878,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"I don't know how long they tortured him...but amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words."
11879,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Shire! Baggins! That will lead them here!
11880,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Take it! Take it!
11881,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"No, Frodo..."
11882,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,You must take it.
11883,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,You cannot offer me this ring.
11884,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,I'm giving it to you!
11885,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Don't tempt me, Frodo. I dare not take it, not even to keep it safe."
11886,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Understand, Frodo...I would use this Ring from a desire to do good...but through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine."
11887,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,But it cannot stay in the Shire!
11888,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"No, no it can't."
11889,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,What must I do?
11890,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"You must leave, and leave quickly. Get out of the Shire."
11891,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Where? Where shall I go?
11892,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Make for the village of Bree.
11893,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Bree? What about you?
11894,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"I will, be waiting for you at the Inn of the Prancing Pony. Frodo packs his food into his knapsack."
11895,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,And the ring will be safe there?
11896,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"I don't know, Frodo. I don't have any answers. I must see the Head of my Order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo. He'll know what to go."
11897,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,You'll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you...for that name is not safe outside the Shire. GANDALF helps FRODO into his coat.
11898,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Travel only by day and stay off the road.
11899,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,I can cut across country easily enough.
11900,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"My dear Frodo, Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet, after a hundred years, they can still surprise you."
11901,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Get down!
11902,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Confound it all! Samwise Gamgee, have you been eavesdropping?"
11903,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"I ain't been dropping no eaves, sir! Honest. I was just cutting the grass under the window there, if you follow me..."
11904,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"It's a little late for trimming the hedges, don't you think?"
11905,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,I heard raised voices...
11906,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,What did you hear? Speak!
11907,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"Nothing important...that is, I heard a good deal about a ring...and a Dark Lord. And something about the end of the world, but...Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me! Don't turn me into anything unnatural!"
11908,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,No?
11909,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Perhaps not. I've thought of a better use for you.
11910,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Come along, Samwise...keep up..."
11911,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Be careful, both of you. The Enemy has many spies in his service, many ways of hearing...birds, beasts..."
11912,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Is it safe?
11913,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Never put it on, for then the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power...Always remember, Frodo, the ring is trying to get back to its master...it wants to be found. Gandalf wheels his horse and gallops away."
11914,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,This is it.
11915,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,This is what?
11916,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,If I take one more step it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.
11917,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"Come on, Sam."
11918,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Remember what Bilbo used to say...it's a dangerous business...
11919,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Saruman!
11920,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Beyond any doubt.
11921,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"All these long years it was in the Shire, under my very nose."
11922,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,We still have time...time enough to counter Sauron...if we act quickly.
11923,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,The eye of Sauron.
11924,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,You know this? How?
11925,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman."
11926,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"They are not all accounted for, the lost seeing-stones...we do not know who else may be watching. Gandalf throws the cloth back over the Palantir."
11927,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,The nine!
11928,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,They have reached the Shire? Saruman shrugs...
11929,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the wise abandon reason for madness?"
11930,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"Mr. Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo turns, surprised as Sam comes running towards him."
11931,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"I thought I lost you. Frodo looks at Sam suspiciously. Sam glances down, embarrassed."
11932,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,What are you talking about?
11933,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,It's just something Gandalf said...
11934,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,What did he say?
11935,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"He said...""Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."" And I don't mean to."
11936,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Sam...we're still in the Shire...what could possibly happen?
11937,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,What's the meaning of this!
11938,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!
11939,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Trust a Brandybuck and a Took.
11940,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,A shortcut to what?
11941,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,I think we should get off the road.
11942,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Get off the road!
11943,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Frodo?
11944,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Anything?
11945,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Nothing.
11946,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Get down!
11947,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,I have to leave the Shire...Sam and I must get to Bree.
11948,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Frodo!
11949,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,How far to the nearest crossing?
11950,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Come on.
11951,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,We're headed for the prancing pony.
11952,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"We wish to stay at the inn...our business is our own. To Frodo's relief, the Gatekeeper unlocks the gate."
11953,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Excuse me.
11954,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Underhill...my name's Underbill.
11955,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,We're friends of Gandalf the Grey...can you tell him we've arrived? BUTTERBUR frowns...
11956,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,What do we do now?
11957,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"Sam, he'll be here. He'll come."
11958,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,You've had a whole half already. Merry watches Pippin go.
11959,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we've arrived.
11960,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is he?"
11961,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Strider.
11962,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Pippin!
11963,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,What do you want?
11964,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,I carry nothing.
11965,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Who are you?
11966,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Yes.
11967,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"Let him go or I'll have you, Longshanks!"
11968,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Where are they?
11969,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Where are you taking us?
11970,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,We have no choice but to trust him.
11971,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"Did you hear that, Bill? Rivendell! We're going to see the Elves!"
11972,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,What are you doing?
11973,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo."
11974,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"Put it out, you fools! Put it out! Frodo desperately kicks dirt on the fire!"
11975,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Go! !
11976,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"Back, you devils!"
11977,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,No!
11978,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Frodo!
11979,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Mr. Frodo!!
11980,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"Help him, Strider!"
11981,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Do something.
11982,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,We are six days from Rivendell. Frodo groans.
11983,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"He'll never make it! Close on: Frodo...head lolling about, barely conscious."
11984,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Gandalf...Gandalf?
11985,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Athelas?
11986,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Kingsfoil. Aye. It's a weed.
11987,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,She's an elf.
11988,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,What are you doing! Those Wraiths are still out there!
11989,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Where am I?
11990,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"You are in the House of Elrond, and it is ten o'clock in the morning on October the twenty-fourth, if you want to know."
11991,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Gandalf!
11992,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Yes, I'm here and you're lucky to be here, too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. You have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit."
11993,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"What happened, Gandalf? Why didn't you meet us?"
11994,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,I'm sorry Frodo.
11995,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,I was delayed.
11996,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only one who can bend it to his will...and he does not share power.
11997,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Gandalf! What is it? Gandalf returns his attention to Frodo.
11998,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Nothing, Frodo..."
11999,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"Frodo! Frodo! Bless you, you're awake!!"
12000,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Sam has hardly left your side.
12001,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"We were worried about you--weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?"
12002,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend. ELROND, LORD OF THE HIGH ELVES, steps up to Frodo's"
12003,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Bilbo!
12004,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Bilbo!
12005,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"""There and back again: A Hobbit's tale"" by Bilbo Baggins."
12006,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,This is wonderful.
12007,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"I miss the Shire...I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else...off with you, on one of your adventures... But my own adventure, turned out to be quite different...I'm not like you, Bilbo."
12008,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"No, what have I forgotten? Pull back to reveal Frodo, hands in his pocket, watching Sam."
12009,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Packed already?
12010,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,No harm in being prepared. Frodo strolls to the edge of the Balcony.
12011,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"I thought you wanted to see the Elves, Sam?"
12012,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,I do...
12013,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,More than anything.
12014,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"I did. It's just...we did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this far, to Rivendell...and I thought... seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon. Off home."
12015,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"You're right, Sam. Frodo looks at Sam..."
12016,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"...we did what we set out to do. Frodo opens his hand, the Ring sits in his Palm."
12017,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,The ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am ready to go home.
12018,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life.
12019,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,It is a burden he should never have to had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.
12020,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"His treachery runs deeper than you know. By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc with Goblin Men...he is breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in Sunlight and cover great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring."
12021,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,It is in Men that we must place our hope.
12022,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"There is one who could unite them, one who could re claim the thrown of Gondor."
12023,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,"Havo dad, Legolas...Sit down, Legolas.."
12024,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Aragorn is right...we cannot use it.
12025,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Do you not understand? While we bicker among ourselves, Sauron's power grows! No one will escape it. You will all be destroyed, your homes burnt and your families put to the sword!"
12026,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,I will take it...I will take it...I will take the Ring to Mordor.
12027,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Though...I do not know the way. Gandalf rises to his feet.
12028,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear."
12029,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,"If, by my life or death, I can protect you, I will. ...you have my sword. Aragorn steps forward...followed by Legolas and Gimli."
12030,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Here!
12031,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Mr. Frodo's not gong anywhere without me.
12032,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,It's so light!
12033,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"We must hold to his course west of the misty Mountains for forty days. If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us. From there, our road turns east, to Mordor."
12034,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Should not be too hard...
12035,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"No, Gimli. I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice."
12036,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,What is that?
12037,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Hide!
12038,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Spies of Saruman. The passage South is being watched.
12039,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,We must take the pass of Caradhras!
12040,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Boromir?
12041,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Boromir...give the ring to Frodo. ARAGORN'S HAND moves to his sword hilt.
12042,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,It's Saruman.
12043,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,He's trying to bring down the mountain. Gandalf! We must turn back!
12044,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,No!
12045,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho I ruith. Sleep Caradhras, be still, lie still, hold your wrath."
12046,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard.
12047,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Let the ringbearer decide.
12048,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Frodo?
12049,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,We will go through the mines. Gandalf slowly nods.
12050,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,So be it.
12051,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Itidin...it mirrors only starlight and moonlight.
12052,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"It reads, ""The door of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter."""
12053,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"It's quite simple. If you are a friend, speak the password and the doors will open."
12054,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!"
12055,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,"Mines are no place for a Pony, even one so brave as Bill."
12056,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"Bye, Bill."
12057,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,"Go on, Bill, go on..don't worry, Sam...he knows his way home. Aragorn slaps Bill on the rump...Bill goes trotting off. CLOSE ON: Sam watching Bill disappear into the darkness."
12058,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"Goodbye, Bill."
12059,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Do not disturb the water.
12060,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,It's a riddle...
12061,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"Speak, friend, and enter. What's the Elvish for friend?"
12062,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Oh...mellon.
12063,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Into the mines!
12064,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,We now have but one choice...we must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard...there are older and fouler things than the Orcs in the deep places of the world.
12065,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to the other side. Let us hope that our presence will go unnoticed."
12066,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,I have no memory of this place.
12067,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,There's something down there.
12068,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,It's Gollum.
12069,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Gollum!
12070,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,He's been following us for three days.
12071,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?
12072,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Escaped...or was set loose. And now the Ring has drawn him here...he will never be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the ring, as he hates and loves himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story. Gandalf catches Frodo's look of surprise."
12073,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Yes...Smeagol he was once called...Before the ring came to him, before it drove him mad."
12074,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.
12075,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death, and some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Frodo frowns."
12076,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment...even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many."
12077,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,I wish the ring had never come to me...I wish none of this had happened.
12078,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There is a note of finality in Gandalf's voice."
12079,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In which case, you also were meant to have it...and that is an encouraging thought, Ah! That it's that way! Gandalf points at the right hand tunnel...the Fellowship scramble to their feet."
12080,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"No, but the air doesn't smell so foul down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose! Ye s..."
12081,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf! Frodo gasps at the brief sight of a vast roof, far above"
12082,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"Well, there's an eye opener and no mistake!"
12083,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Gimli!!
12084,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"""Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of Moria."" He is dead, then. It's as I had feared."
12085,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"""They have taken the Bridge and the second hall: we have barred the gates...but cannot hold them for long...the ground shakes...drums in the deep...we cannot get out. A shadow moves in the dark. Will no- one save us? They are coming."""
12086,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time and rid us of your stupidity!
12087,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Mr. Frodo!
12088,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.
12089,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,I think I'm getting the hang of this.
12090,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Aragorn! Aragorn!
12091,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Frodo!!
12092,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,He's alive!
12093,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,I'm alright. I'm not hurt.
12094,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,You should be dead. That spear would've skewered a wild boar!
12095,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,I think there's more to this hobbit than meets the eye.
12096,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,To the bridge of Khazad-dum!
12097,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,This way!
12098,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world! This foe is beyond any of you! Run! Quickly!
12099,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Lead them on, Aragorn. The bridge is near."
12100,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Do as I say; swords are no more use here.
12101,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Over the bridge! Fly!
12102,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,You cannot pass!
12103,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Gandalf!
12104,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun."
12105,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,Go back to the shadow! The BALROG slashes at Gandalf with its Sword of
12106,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"You shall not pass!! The Balrog places one foot onto the bridge. Aragorn and Boromir race forward, swords drawn."
12107,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Gandalf!
12108,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,"Fly, you fools!"
12109,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,No!
12110,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Gandalf!
12111,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,"Legolas, get them up!"
12112,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,"By nightfall these hills will be swarming with Orcs! We must reach the woods of Lothlorien. Come, Boromir, Legolas, Gimli, get them up. On your feet, Sam."
12113,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,"Boromir glances towards Frodo, then back at Aragorn. Frodo is walking away, as if in a daze."
12114,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Frodo? Frodo!
12115,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Mr. Frodo?
12116,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,"Haldir of Lorien, we come here for your help. We need your protection."
12117,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Take some rest..these borders are well protected.
12118,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,I have seen the white city..long ago.
12119,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,What will I see?
12120,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Gandalf!
12121,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"If you ask it of me, I will give you the One Ring."
12122,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,I cannot do this alone...
12123,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"Then I know what I must do. It's just...I'm afraid to do it. Galadriel kneels down to Frodo's height, staring at him intently."
12124,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Frodo.
12125,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,The Argonath...
12126,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old...my kin.
12127,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,"We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the boats and continue on foot..we approach Mordor from the North."
12128,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,"That is our Road...I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf."
12129,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.
12130,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"I know what you would say, and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart."
12131,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,There is no other way.
12132,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,No. . .
12133,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,You are not yourself.
12134,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Frodo?
12135,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,It has taken Boromir. ARAGORN moves towards Frodo...
12136,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Where is the ring?
12137,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Stay away!
12138,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Frodo...I swore to protect you.
12139,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Can you protect me from yourself?
12140,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Would you destroy it?
12141,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,I would have gone with you to the end... into the very fires of Mordor.
12142,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"I know...Look after the others, especially Sam...he will not understand."
12143,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,"Go, Frodo!"
12144,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Run! Run!!
12145,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Mr. Frodo!
12146,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Boromir!
12147,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,I let Frodo go.
12148,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,The ring is beyond our reach now.
12149,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,"No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You have kept your honor. Aragorn tries to bind Boromir's wound."
12150,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,"I do not know what strength is in my blood, but I swear to you... I will not let the White City fall, nor your people fail..."
12151,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,"Be at peace, son of Gondor. Aragorn bends and Kisses Boromir's forehead."
12152,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Legolas and Gimli appear behind him...Aragorn stands.
12153,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,They will look for his coming from the white tower...but he will not return.
12154,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Mr. Frodo!
12155,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,I wish the ring had never come to me..I wish none of this had happened...
12156,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,GANDALF,So do all who lie to see such times...but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.
12157,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo, in the boat, paddling steadfastly away from the"
12158,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"No, Sam."
12159,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"Go back,Sam. I'm going to Mordor alone."
12160,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Of course you are...and I'm coming with you!
12161,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,You can't swim.
12162,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Sam!
12163,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"I made a promise, Mr. Frodo...a promise. ""Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."" And I don't mean to...I don't mean to."
12164,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,"Oh, Sam!"
12165,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Come on then..
12166,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.
12167,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,"Not if we hold true to each other. We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death, not while we have strength left."
12168,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,Leave all that can be spared behind... CLOSE ON: ARAGORN..a steely light in his eye.
12169,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,ARAGORN,We travel light. Let's hunt some Orc.
12170,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Mordor! I hope the others find a safer road.
12171,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,Strider'll look after them.
12172,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.
12173,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,SAM,"We may yet, Mr. Frodo. We may."
12174,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,Sam?
12175,Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The,FRODO,I'm glad you're with me.
12176,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,"Haven't you had any sleep, Mr Frodo?"
12177,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,No . . . no it isn't. It isn't midday yet. The days are growing darker.
12178,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.
12179,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,Here.
12180,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,What about you?
12181,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,"I'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas bread."
12182,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,Sam.
12183,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,Alright. We don't have that much left.
12184,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,For what?
12185,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,The journey home.
12186,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,Hobbits!
12187,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,"And there Saruman must remain, under your guard, Treebeard."
12188,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,No. He has no power any more.
12189,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,"Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad!"
12190,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,ARAGORN,No news of Frodo?
12191,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,No word ... nothing.
12192,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,ARAGORN,We till have time.
12193,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,Do we know that?
12194,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,ARAGORN,What does your heart tell you?
12195,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,"That Frodo is alive. Yes - yes, he is alive."
12196,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,", . You treacherous little toad!"
12197,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,"No, Sam! Leave him alone!"
12198,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,I heard it from his own mouth he means to murder us!
12199,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!
12200,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,Sm. . .
12201,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,Call me a liar! You're a liar!
12202,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,"Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost."
12203,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,"I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I won' t wait around for him to kill us !"
12204,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,I'm not sending him away.
12205,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,"You don't see it, do you? He's a villain!"
12206,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,"We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side."
12207,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,"I'm on your side, Mr Frodo."
12208,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,"I know, Sam, I know. You must trust me."
12209,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,Fool of a Took!
12210,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,Minas Tirith??? Is that what you saw?
12211,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,And what did you tell him? Speak!
12212,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?
12213,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,"There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool, but an honest fool he remains. He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring."
12214,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,ARAGORN,I will go.
12215,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,No!
12216,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,ARAGORN,They must be warned.
12217,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,"They will be. You must come to Minas Tirith by another ra ... od Follow the river, look to the black ships. Understand this . . . things are now in motion that cannot be undone."
12218,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,"Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin, Took, you are the worst. Hurry, hurry!"
12219,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and you'd better hope we don't have one of those on our tail.
12220,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,"Run Shadowfax, show us the meaning of haste."
12221,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,We have just passed into the realm of Condor!
12222,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,Minas Tirith . . . City of the Kings.
12223,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,"Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of the King."
12224,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,"Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor."
12225,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,Pippin!
12226,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,"Get up! My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming ... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As Steward, you are charged with the defence of this city. Where are Condor's armies?"
12227,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King - Steward!
12228,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,Come.
12229,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,"You're in the service of the Steward now - you're going to have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took . . . Guard of the Citadel!"
12230,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,It's the deep breath before the plunge.
12231,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,There never was much hope.
12232,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammerstroke will fall hardest.
12233,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,"The Witchking of Angmar . . . , . You've met him before . . ."
12234,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,"No, Mr Frodo!"
12235,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,No!
12236,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,They're calling me!
12237,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,We come to it at last ... the great battle of our time.
12238,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,"The board is set, the pieces are moving."
12239,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,"Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task to be done. Another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth!"
12240,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,Amon Din ... come on . . .
12241,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,Hope is kindled.
12242,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,ARAGORN,The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit! Condor calls for aid!
12243,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,ARAGORN,You ride with us?
12244,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,Foreseen and done nothing!
12245,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,Where? When?
12246,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,. . . And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol.
12247,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,Faramir . . . Tell me everything.
12248,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,Mr Frodo!
12249,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,"What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we?"
12250,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,"Alright, alright - you just startled me is all. What were you doing?"
12251,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,"Fine, have it your own way."
12252,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,It's always dark here -
12253,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,What? That's all we have left!
12254,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,He took it! He must have!
12255,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,You're a lying wretch! What did you do with it?
12256,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,He doesn't eat it . . . he can't have taken it.
12257,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,That's a filthy lie!
12258,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,Sam! Stop it!
12259,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,I'll kill him! I'll kill him!
12260,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,"No, Sam!"
12261,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,"Alight, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to go so far, I was so angry . . . Here, let's rest up a bit."
12262,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,I ' m alright.
12263,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,"No, no, you're not alright! You're exhausted! It's that Gollum; it's this place; it's that thing around your neck. I could help a bit . . . I could carry it for a while - share the load."
12264,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,Get away!
12265,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,I don't want to keep it . . . I just want to help!
12266,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,"Shut up, you! Go away. Get out of here."
12267,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,"No, Sam . . . it's you."
12268,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,But . . . he's a liar . . . he's poisoned you against me.
12269,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,You can't help me anymore.
12270,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,SAM,You don't mean that.
12271,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,FRODO,Go home.
12272,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,Faramir! Your father's will has turned to madness! Do not throw away your life so rashly!
12273,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,GANDALF,"Your father loves you, Faramir! And will remember it before the end."
12274,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,ARAGORN,Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.
12275,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,ARAGORN,"My Lord, Elrond."
12276,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,ARAGORN,She stayed?
12277,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,ARAGORN,"It will not be our end, but his."
12278,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,ARAGORN,There are none.
12279,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,ARAGORN,"Murderers, traitors - you would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing. They answer to no-one."
12280,Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King,ARAGORN,Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil . . .
12281,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,You cannot pass!
12282,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Gandalf!
12283,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the Flame of Anor!"
12284,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark Fire will not avail you, Flame of Udûn! [Camera zooms in through the mountain and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog on the bridge of Khazad-dûm. The Balrog strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming sword. Gandalf parries the blow with Glamdring, shattering the Balrogs sword.]"
12285,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,Argh!
12286,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Gandalf!
12287,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"Fly, you fools!"
12288,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Noooooooooooooooo!!!!
12289,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,[Calls after Gandalf as he falls into the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!!
12290,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Gandalf!
12291,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"What is it, Mr. Frodo?"
12292,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.]
12293,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we dont want to see any closer, and the one place were trying to get to. Its just where we cant get. Lets face it, Mr. Frodo, were lost. I dont think Gandalf meant for us to come this way."
12294,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"He didnt mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam... but they did."
12295,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"Mr. Frodo? Its the Ring, isnt it?"
12296,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"Its getting heavier. [Clutches the Ring by his chest and sits down, still panting. He then fumbles for his water bottle and takes a sip.]"
12297,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,What food have we got left?
12298,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"Well, let me see. [He takes out a package of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes, lovely  Lembas bread. And look! [He digs deeper into his pack] More lembas bread."
12299,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"I don't usually hold with foreign food, but this Elvish stuff, its not bad."
12300,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"[smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it Sam?"
12301,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Those rain clouds might.
12302,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,[Looks around] This looks strangely familiar.
12303,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,[Exasperated] Its because weve been here before! Were going in circles.
12304,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?
12305,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper] Were not alone.
12306,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"[menacingly] This is Sting. Youve seen it before, havent you... Gollum! Release him or Ill cut your throat!"
12307,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Quiet you!
12308,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Its hopeless! Every Orc in Mordors going to hear this racket! Lets just tie him up and leave him.
12309,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Its no more than you deserve!
12310,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"Maybe he does deserve to die, but now that I see him, I do pity him."
12311,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Theres no promise you can make that I can trust.
12312,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.
12313,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"I dont believe you! [Gollum backs away, frightened, and climbs onto a boulder] Get down! I said, down!"
12314,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Sam!
12315,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Hes trying to trick us! We let him go hell throttle us in our sleep!
12316,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,You know the way to Mordor?
12317,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Youve been there before?
12318,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,You will lead us to the Black Gate.
12319,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Their pace has quickened. [He looks up.] They must have caught our scent. Hurry! [He runs off.]
12320,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
12321,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Less than a day ahead of us. Come! [Runs off again]
12322,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"Rohan. Home of the horse-lords. There is something strange at work here. Some evil gives speed to these creatures, sets its will against us."
12323,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see?"
12324,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Saruman.
12325,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"Riders of Rohan, what news from the Mark?"
12326,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This is Gimli, son of Glóin and Legolas of the Woodland realm. We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king."
12327,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,We are not spies. We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain. Theyve taken two of our friends captive.
12328,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,They would be small  only children to your eyes.
12329,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,[Kicks a helmet and yells] AAARRGGHH!!! [He falls to his knees.]
12330,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"A hobbit lay here, and the other. [Flashback: Pippin yells as he looks up at a pair of thrashing hooves bearing down on him. He rolls over, avoiding the hooves.] They crawled."
12331,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Their hands were bound. [Flashback: Merry rubs his bonds furiously against the sharp edge of a weapon.] Their bonds were cut. [Aragorn holds up a broken length of thick rope.]
12332,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,They ran over here. They were followed.
12333,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,The tracks lead away from the battle... [They break into a run and then stop] into Fangorn Forest.
12334,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"Whoa, its a bog! Hes led us into a swamp!"
12335,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,There are dead things! Dead faces in the water!
12336,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Ohh!
12337,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Frodo!
12338,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,[Looks at Gollum in perplexed gratitude and disbelief.] Gollum...
12339,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,[Runs to Frodos side.] Mr. Frodo! Are you alright?
12340,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,What did you say?
12341,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,[Moves over and crouches in front of Gollum] Who are you?
12342,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk.
12343,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,He said your life was a sad story.
12344,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"You were not so very different from a hobbit once, were you... Sméagol?"
12345,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"That was your name once, wasnt it? A long time ago."
12346,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Black Riders!
12347,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Argh!
12348,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Argh!!
12349,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Cmon Frodo! C'mon!
12350,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,I thought they were dead!
12351,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Mr. Frodo! Its alright. Im here.
12352,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,These are strange tracks.
12353,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,[Whispers] Gimli!
12354,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,[Gestures] Lower your axe.
12355,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Man cenich?
12356,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.
12357,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,We must be quick.
12358,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Where are they?
12359,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Who are you? Show yourself!
12360,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,It cannot be. You fell.
12361,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"Through fire and water. [Flashback: Gandalf is battling the Balrog atop Dúrins Tower.] From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth."
12362,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside."
12363,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"Darkness took me. And I strayed out of thought and time. [Camera zooms in Gandalfs eye and enters an amorphous realm of stars and galaxies, ending in a blinding white light] Stars wheeled overhead and everyday was as long as a life-age of the earth. But it was not the end. I felt life in me again."
12364,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,I've been sent back until my task is done.
12365,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Gandalf!
12366,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,Gandalf? Yes... That's what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name. [He smiles]
12367,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,[With a twinkle in his eye] I am Gandalf the White. [Aragorn grins] And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
12368,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"One stage of your journey is over, another begins. War has come to Rohan. We must ride to Edoras with all speed."
12369,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,Shadowfax. [Gimli bows in the background.] He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers.
12370,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
12371,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,I did.
12372,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Thats it then. We cannot get past that.
12373,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"Look! The gate, it's opening! I can see a way down."
12374,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"Sam, no!"
12375,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Argh!!
12376,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"I do not ask you to come with me, Sam."
12377,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there."
12378,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Now!
12379,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Why havent you spoken of this before?!
12380,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Hes up to something.
12381,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Are you saying theres another way into Mordor?
12382,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"Hes led us this far, Sam."
12383,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"Mr. Frodo, no."
12384,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Hes been true to his word.
12385,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,[Whispers] No!
12386,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"Lead the way, Sméagol."
12387,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan, whose mind is overthrown. Sarumans hold over King Théoden is now very strong."
12388,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,Be careful what you say. Do not look for welcome here.
12389,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,[sees Háma] Ah.
12390,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You would not part an old man from his walking stick? [Looks at Háma innocently.]
12391,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Théoden King."
12392,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind you teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm! [Raises his staff against Gríma.]
12393,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"Théoden, son of Thengel, too long have you sat in the shadows."
12394,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,Hearken to me! I release you from the spell. [Gestures with his hand]
12395,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"[Points his staff towards Théoden.] I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound."
12396,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Wait.
12397,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"You did not kill me, you will not kill him!"
12398,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,Be gone!!
12399,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"Breathe the free air again, my friend."
12400,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword.
12401,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been spilled on his account."
12402,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,Théodreds death was not of your making.
12403,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. Westu hál. Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu."
12404,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women and children. [Leans forward and puts a hand on Théodens chair. Théoden looks at his hand warily.] You must fight.
12405,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak. Éomer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for their king.
12406,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Open war is upon you. Whether you would risk it or not.
12407,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,Then what is the kings decision?
12408,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Hes only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helms Deep has saved them in the past.
12409,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"There is no way out of that ravine. Théoden is walking into a trap. He thinks hes leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre. Théoden has a strong will but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of Rohan. He will need you before the end, Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. The defences HAVE to hold."
12410,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,They will hold.
12411,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"[Turns to Shadowfax and strokes him] The Grey Pilgrim... thats what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of men Ive walked this earth and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in vain. Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East."
12412,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,[Opens the stall gates] Go.
12413,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,You have some skill with a blade.
12414,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"What do you fear, my lady?"
12415,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden of Rohan. [He sheaths his knife.] I do not think that would be your fate."
12416,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Hey Stinker! Dont go getting too far ahead!
12417,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Why do you do that?
12418,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,What?
12419,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Call him names; run him down all the time.
12420,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"Because because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about."
12421,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"[Glaring at Sam] You have no idea what it did to him. What its still doing to him. [He walks past Sam and stops.] I want to help him, Sam..."
12422,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Why?
12423,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Because I have to believe he can come back.
12424,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"You cant save him, Mr. Frodo."
12425,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,[Snapping at Sam]What do you know about it? Nothing!
12426,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"[With remorse] I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that."
12427,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"[Looks back at Frodo with tears in his eyes.] I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your eyes off it. I've seen you. You're not eating. You barely sleep. It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo. You have to fight it!"
12428,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,[Grows angry again] I know what I have to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to me! It's my task! Mine! My own! [He walks away]
12429,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Cant you hear yourself? Dont you know who you sound like?
12430,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"Youll make him sick, you will, behaving like that! [Holding up the two rabbits] Theres only one way to eat a brace of coneys."
12431,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Whats to ruin? Theres hardly any meat on em.
12432,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,What we need is a few good taters.
12433,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,PO-TAY-TOES! Boil em. Mash em. Stick em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish....
12434,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Even you couldnt say no to that. [He takes a sip of the stew]
12435,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Youre hopeless.
12436,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Mr. Frodo?
12437,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Who are they?
12438,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Ready to do what?
12439,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"Weve got to get moving. Come on, Sam."
12440,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,[Suddenly grabs Frodos arm] Mr Frodo! Look! Its an Oliphaunt!
12441,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,No one at home will believe this...
12442,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,[Looking around] Sméagol?
12443,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"Weve lingered here too long. Come on, Sam!"
12444,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Ah!
12445,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,[Gestures and whispers] Its the beards....
12446,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,I am asleep. This is a dream.
12447,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Min lû pennich nin i aur hen telitha.
12448,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,[Walks over to Arwen] Dolen i vâd o nin.
12449,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Arwen
12450,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,But never more than a memory.
12451,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,She stays because she still has hope.
12452,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Idhren emmen menna gui ethwel. Hae o auth a nîr a naeth.
12453,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"I am mortal; you are Elfkind. It was a dream, Arwen, nothing more."
12454,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,This belongs to you.
12455,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"She is sailing to the Undying Lands, with all that is left of her kin."
12456,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,[Running back to Théoden] Wargs! We are under attack!
12457,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Get them out of here!
12458,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"[Mumbles] Brego [He grabs hold of Bregos mane, pulls himself onto the horse and rides slowly to Helms Deep.]"
12459,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Spies?! Now wait just a minute!
12460,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.
12461,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,His gardener.
12462,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,[The merest hesitation.] There was no other.
12463,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in Mória. Two were my kin. A Dwarf there was also, and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor."
12464,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Yes... for my part.
12465,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,[Shocked] Dead? How? When?
12466,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"Wait! [Faramir stops] This creature is bound to me. And I to him. He is our guide. Please, let me go down to him."
12467,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"Sméagol. [Gollum turns round at Frodos voice.] Master is here. Come, Sméagol. Trust master. Come!"
12468,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"Sméagol, you must trust master. Follow me, come on. Come. Come, Sméagol. Nice Sméagol. Thats it. Come on."
12469,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Dont hurt him! Sméagol dont struggle! Sméagol listen to me!
12470,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"We have to get out of here. You go. Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. Disappear."
12471,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"I cant. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me, but Im sorry. The Rings taking me Sam. If I put it on, hell find me. Hell see."
12472,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Mr. Frodo...
12473,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,No!! [He runs away from Faramir]
12474,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Stop it! Leave him alone! Dont you understand? Hes got to destroy it. Thats where were going. Into Mordor. To the mountain of fire.
12475,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Please. Its such a burden. Will you not help him?
12476,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"[Patting Brego on the neck] Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn."
12477,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"Gimli, where is the king?"
12478,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Hannon le.
12479,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,All Isengard is emptied
12480,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Ten thousand strong at least.
12481,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,It is an army bred for a single purpose: to destroy the world of men. They will be here by nightfall.
12482,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,They do not come to destroy Rohans crops or villages. They come to destroy its people. Down to the last child.
12483,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"Send out riders, my lord. You must call for aid."
12484,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Gondor will answer.
12485,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These are no soldiers."
12486,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Si beriathar hýn. Amar nâ ned Edoras.
12487,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Then I shall die as one them! [He pauses and then walks away. Legolas makes as if to go after him.]
12488,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Give me your sword. What is your name?
12489,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"This is a good sword, Haleth, son of Háma."
12490,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,There is always hope.
12491,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"Ú-moe edhored, Legolas."
12492,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"[He bows] Mae govannen, Haldir. [He grabs Haldir in a huge embrace. Initially stunned, Haldir hugs him back lightly.]"
12493,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,You are most welcome!
12494,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"A Eruchîn, ú-dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le faelas!"
12495,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Dartho!
12496,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Tangado halad!
12497,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Leithio i philinn!
12498,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Fire!
12499,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Pendraid!
12500,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Swords! Swords!
12501,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Na fennas! [Directs the Elf archers to aim at the Uruk-hai column.]
12502,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"Togo hon dad, Legolas! [Legolas shoots the Uruk-hai in the shoulder but the latter keeps going] Dago hon! Dago hon!"
12503,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Gimli! [He yells to the Elves behind him] Hado i philinn!
12504,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Herio!
12505,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"Na Barad! Na Baraad! Haldir, na Barad!"
12506,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,"[Sees Haldir falling] HALDIR!! [He runs up the steps to Haldirs side and catches him and he collapses. Haldir's head rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing. Aragorn bows his head in grief. Then with a cry, he jumps onto a ladder and swings down to the ground, killing as he goes.]"
12507,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,[Runs up and stabs away at the Uruk-hai through the broken gate] How long do you need?
12508,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Gimli!
12509,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Its a long way.
12510,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,What?
12511,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Not a word.
12512,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Hurry! Inside! Get them inside!
12513,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"[With tears in his eyes] The Ring will not save Gondor. It has only the power to destroy. Please, let me go."
12514,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"Faramir, you must let me go!"
12515,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Mr Frodo!
12516,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"Its calling to him, Sam. His eye is almost on me."
12517,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"Hold on, Mr. Frodo You'll be alright..."
12518,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"Do you want to know what happened to Boromir? You want to know why your brother died? He tried to take the Ring from Frodo! After swearing an oath to protect him, he tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad!"
12519,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Mr Frodo?
12520,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,[In a faraway voice] Theyre here. Theyve come.
12521,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,[Carrying a table with Legolas to shore up the door of the hall] You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it! They still defend it! They have died defending it!
12522,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves? [There is no answer.] Is there no other way?
12523,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass. And barricade the entrance.
12524,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,[Pause] Ride out with me. Ride out and meet them.
12525,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,For Rohan. For your people.
12526,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the east."
12527,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,ARAGORN,Gandalf.
12528,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,Théoden king stands alone.
12529,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,What are you doing? Where are you going?!
12530,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Aaarrgghh!!!
12531,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,[With tears running down his face] Its me. Its your Sam. Dont you know your Sam?
12532,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"[Slowly and with despair] I cant do this, Sam."
12533,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"[Getting up slowly] I know. Its all wrong. By rights we shouldnt even be here. But we are. [He stands and leans against a wall, looking out into the distance.] Its like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didnt want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? [Images of the riders winning the battle against the Uruk-hai at Helms Deep] How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?"
12534,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"But in the end, its only a passing thing, this shadow. [The women and children welcome the men as they return. Éowyn runs up to Aragorn and embraces him, crying tears of relief.] Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. [Isengard is flooded. Merry and Pippin looks on from their perch on Treebeard. On the balcony, Saruman stumbles back into his chamber] And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didnt. They kept going because they were holding on to something."
12535,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"What are we holding on to, Sam?"
12536,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"Theres some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And its worth fighting for."
12537,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,GANDALF,"Saurons wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift. The battle for Helms Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin. All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere in the wilderness."
12538,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,I wonder if well ever be put into songs or tales.
12539,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,What?
12540,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"I wonder if people will ever say, lets hear about Frodo and the Ring. And theyll say yes, thats one of my favorite stories. Frodo was really courageous, wasnt he, dad. Yes, my boy, the most famousest of hobbits. And thats saying alot."
12541,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,"Huh, you left out one of the chief characters  Samwise the Brave. I want to hear more about Sam."
12542,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Frodo wouldnt have got far without Sam.
12543,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldnt make fun. I was being serious."
12544,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,[smiling] So was I. [He turns to walk on]
12545,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,[Dreamily] Samwise the Brave. [He gives his backpack a heave and follows Frodo]
12546,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Sméagol!
12547,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,Were not gonna wait for you. Come on!
12548,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,SAM,"Wheres he gone? Hey Gollum, where are you?"
12549,Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers,FRODO,Sméagol?
12550,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,I know. Stay calm.
12551,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Yes.
12552,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,You have to focus. There is a phone. Wells and Laxe. You can make it.
12553,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Go.
12554,Matrix-The,NEO,Fuckin' idiots don't know shit.
12555,Matrix-The,NEO,What the hell...
12556,Matrix-The,NEO,"What do you want, Anthony?"
12557,Matrix-The,NEO,You got the money this time?
12558,Matrix-The,NEO,I don't know. I have to work tomorrow.
12559,Matrix-The,NEO,"Yeah, yeah. Sure, I'll go."
12560,Matrix-The,NEO,How did you know that --
12561,Matrix-The,NEO,Who are you?
12562,Matrix-The,NEO,Trinity? The Trinity? The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
12563,Matrix-The,NEO,Gee-zus.
12564,Matrix-The,NEO,I just thought... you were a guy.
12565,Matrix-The,NEO,Do you want to go sorewhere and talk?
12566,Matrix-The,NEO,"That was you on the board tonight. That was your note, wasn't it?"
12567,Matrix-The,NEO,Who wouldn't?
12568,Matrix-The,NEO,What? Why?
12569,Matrix-The,NEO,I don't understand --
12570,Matrix-The,NEO,The Matrix. What is the Matrix?
12571,Matrix-The,NEO,Wait. Who was it? Who was the man?
12572,Matrix-The,NEO,Shitshitshit.
12573,Matrix-The,NEO,"Yes, Mr. Rhineheart. Perfectly clear."
12574,Matrix-The,NEO,"If I was late again, I'm going to be fired."
12575,Matrix-The,NEO,Yeah. That's me.
12576,Matrix-The,NEO,Hello?
12577,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Hello, Neo. This is Morpheus."
12578,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"I had hoped for this conversation to take place under less adverse conditions, but you can never count on hope, can you, Neo?"
12579,Matrix-The,NEO,... no.
12580,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"I've been watching you, Neo, and I want to meet you. I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time. They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do."
12581,Matrix-The,NEO,Who's coming for me?
12582,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Stand up and see for yourself.
12583,Matrix-The,NEO,Right now?
12584,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Yes. Now.
12585,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Do it slowly. Slowly. The elevator.
12586,Matrix-The,NEO,Holy fuckin' shit!
12587,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Yes.
12588,Matrix-The,NEO,What the fuck do they want with me?!
12589,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"I'm not sure. But, if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there."
12590,Matrix-The,NEO,How?!
12591,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say."
12592,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,The cubicle across from you is empty.
12593,Matrix-The,NEO,But what if...?
12594,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Go! Now!
12595,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Stay here for a moment.
12596,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,A little longer...
12597,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"When I tell you, go to the end of the row to the first office on the left, stay.as low as you can."
12598,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Now.
12599,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Good. Now there is a window. Open it.
12600,Matrix-The,NEO,How do you know all this?
12601,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"The answer is coming, Neo."
12602,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Outside, there's a scaffold. You can use it to get to the roof."
12603,Matrix-The,NEO,No! It's too far away.
12604,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,There's a small ledge. It's a short climb. You can make it.
12605,Matrix-The,NEO,"No way, no way, this is crazy."
12606,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Don't be controlled by your fear, Neo. There are only two ways out of this building. One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody. You take a chance either way. I leave it to you."
12607,Matrix-The,NEO,This is insane! Why is this happening to me? What did I do? I'm nobody. I didn't do anything. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
12608,Matrix-The,NEO,I'm going to die.
12609,Matrix-The,NEO,This is insane. I can't do this! Forget it!
12610,Matrix-The,NEO,I didn't do anything!
12611,Matrix-The,NEO,Yeah. Wow. That sounds like a real good deal. But I think I have a better one. How about I give you the finger --
12612,Matrix-The,NEO,And you can cram that file up your Secret Service sphincter.
12613,Matrix-The,NEO,You ain't seen nothing yet.
12614,Matrix-The,NEO,You can't scare me with this gestapo crap. I know my rights. I want my phone call.
12615,Matrix-The,NEO,The agents --
12616,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are. If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead."
12617,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,I don't know what you are thinking right now but I want you to understand that I will not give up on you until you give up on me.
12618,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Do you still want to meet?
12619,Matrix-The,NEO,... Yes.
12620,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Take the Howard line south.
12621,Matrix-The,NEO,What are you doing?
12622,Matrix-The,NEO,What are you doing?
12623,Matrix-The,NEO,Jesus! God!
12624,Matrix-The,NEO,Do what?
12625,Matrix-The,NEO,"Oh, shit --"
12626,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,At last.
12627,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Welcome, Neo. As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus."
12628,Matrix-The,NEO,It's an honor.
12629,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Please. Come. Sit.
12630,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Thank you, Trinity."
12631,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?"
12632,Matrix-The,NEO,You could say that.
12633,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,I can see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
12634,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Ironically, this is not far from the truth. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?"
12635,Matrix-The,NEO,"You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you."
12636,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Yes. Thank you. But I think we both know there's more to it than that. Do you believe in fate, Neo?"
12637,Matrix-The,NEO,No.
12638,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Why not?
12639,Matrix-The,NEO,Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
12640,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,I know exactly what you mean.
12641,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Let me tell you why you are here. You are here because you have the gift.
12642,Matrix-The,NEO,What gift?
12643,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"I've watched you, Neo. You do not use a computer like a tool. You use it like it was part of yourself. What you can do inside a computer is not normal. I know. I've seen it. What you do is magic."
12644,Matrix-The,NEO,It's not magic.
12645,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"But it is, Neo. It is. How else would you describe what has been happening to you?"
12646,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,We are trained in this world to accept only what is rational and logical. Have you ever wondered why?
12647,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"As children, we do not separate the possible from the impossible which is why the younger a mind is the easier it is to free while a mind like yours can be very difficult."
12648,Matrix-The,NEO,Free from what?
12649,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,From the Matrix.
12650,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Do you want to know what it is, Neo?"
12651,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"It's that feeling you have had all your life. That feeling that something was wrong with the world. You don't know what it is but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad, driving you to me. But what is it?"
12652,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window, or on your television. You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth."
12653,Matrix-The,NEO,What truth?
12654,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"That you are a slave, Neo. That you, like everyone else, was born into bondage... ... kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind."
12655,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."
12656,Matrix-The,NEO,How?
12657,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Hold out your hands.
12658,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"This is your last chance. After this, there is no going back."
12659,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,You take the blue pill and the story ends. You wake in your bed and you believe whatever you want to believe.
12660,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.
12661,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Remember that all I am offering is the truth. Nothing more.
12662,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Follow me.
12663,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Haven't I always told you, Cypher, not to let fear control your life. Apoc, are we on-line?"
12664,Matrix-The,NEO,Apoc? You wrote the Four Horsemen Virus.
12665,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Neo, time is always against us. Will you take a seat there?"
12666,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,I imagine you know sonething about virtual reality.
12667,Matrix-The,NEO,A little.
12668,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Tell me about it.
12669,Matrix-The,NEO,"Essentially, it's a hardware system that uses an apparatus; headgear, gloves and whatever to make you feel that you are in a computer program."
12670,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"If the virtual reality apparatus, as you called it, was wired to all of your senses and controlled them completely, would you be able to tell the difference between the virtual world and the real world?"
12671,Matrix-The,NEO,"You might not, no."
12672,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"No, you wouldn't."
12673,Matrix-The,NEO,You did all this?
12674,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,The pill you took is part of a trace program. It's going to make things feel a bit strange.
12675,Matrix-The,NEO,Shit...
12676,Matrix-The,NEO,What is this? Mescaline?
12677,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Just relax, Neo."
12678,Matrix-The,NEO,Uh-oh...
12679,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Apoc?
12680,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Tank, we're going to need the signal soon. Stay calm, Neo."
12681,Matrix-The,NEO,It's cold.
12682,Matrix-The,NEO,It's all over me --
12683,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Shit! Apoc?
12684,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Now, Tank now!"
12685,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Welcome to the real world, Neo."
12686,Matrix-The,NEO,... am I dead?
12687,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,I know.
12688,Matrix-The,NEO,What are you doing?
12689,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Your muscles have atrophied. We're rebuilding them.
12690,Matrix-The,NEO,Why do my eyes hurt?
12691,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,You've never used them before.
12692,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Rest, Neo. The answers are coming."
12693,Matrix-The,NEO,"Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?"
12694,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,More important than what is when?
12695,Matrix-The,NEO,When?
12696,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197. I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
12697,Matrix-The,NEO,That's not possible.
12698,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"I promised you the truth, Neo, and the truth is that the world you were living in was a lie."
12699,Matrix-The,NEO,How?
12700,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,I'll show you.
12701,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"This is my ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. It's a hovercraft. Small like a submarine. It's dark. It's cramped and cold. But it's home."
12702,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,This is the main deck. You know most of my crew.
12703,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,The ones you don't know. That's Mouse and Switch. The two big guys are Tank and Dozer.
12704,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"And this, this is the Core. This is where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the Matrix."
12705,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Help him, Trinity."
12706,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Do you remember when I asked you about an apparatus that could turn a virtual reality into reality?
12707,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,It's right here.
12708,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,And it's accessed here.
12709,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,This will feel a little weird.
12710,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,This is the Construct.
12711,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"It is our loading program. We can load anything from clothes, to weapons, to training simulations. Anything we need."
12712,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Sit down.
12713,Matrix-The,NEO,"Right now, we're inside a computer program?"
12714,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Wild, isn't it?"
12715,Matrix-The,NEO,This isn't real?
12716,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"What is real? How do you define real? If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain."
12717,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,This is the Chicago you know. Chicago as it was at the end of the twentieth century. This Chicago exists only as part of a neural-interactive simulation that we call the Matrix.
12718,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"You have been living inside Baulliaurd's vision, inside the map, not the territory. This is Chicago as it exists today."
12719,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,'The desert of the real.'
12720,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"We are, right now, miles below the earth's surface. The only place humans can survive outside the Matrix is underground."
12721,Matrix-The,NEO,What happened?
12722,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"It started early in the twenty- first century, with the birth of artificial intelligence, a singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines."
12723,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"At first all they wanted was to be treated as equals, entitled to the same human inalienable rights. Whatever they were given, it was not enough."
12724,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,We don't know who struck first. Us or them. But sometime at the end of the twenty-first century the battle was joined.
12725,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,The war raged for generations and turned the face of our planet from green and blue to black and red.
12726,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"It scorched and burned the sky. Without the sun, the machines sought out a new energy source to survive."
12727,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"They discovered a new form of fusion. All that was required to initiate the reaction was a small electric charge. Throughout human history we have been dependent on machines to survive. Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony."
12728,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"The human body generates more bio- electricity than a 120-volt battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s of body heat."
12729,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"We are, as an energy source, easily renewable and completely recyclable, the dead liquified and fed intravenously to the living."
12730,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,All they needed to control this new battery was something to occupy our mind.
12731,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"And so they built a prison out of our past, wired it to our brains and turned us into slaves."
12732,Matrix-The,NEO,No! I don't believe it! It's not possible!
12733,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo. I just said that it would be the truth."
12734,Matrix-The,NEO,Stop! Let me out! I want out!
12735,Matrix-The,NEO,Get this thing out of me!
12736,Matrix-The,NEO,Don't touch me! Get away from me!
12737,Matrix-The,NEO,"I can't go back, can I?"
12738,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"No. But if you could, would you really want to?"
12739,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,I feel that I owe you an apology. There is a rule that we do not free a mind once it reaches a certain age. It is dangerous. They have trouble letting go.. Their mind turns against them. I've seen it happen. I broke the rule because I had to.
12740,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"When the Matrix was first built there was a man born inside that had the ability to change what he wanted, to remake the Matrix as he saw fit. It was this man that freed the first of us and taught us the secret of the war; control the Matrix and you control the future."
12741,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"When he died, the Oracle at the temple of Zion prophesied his return and envisioned an end to the war and freedom for our people. That is why there are those of us that have spent our entire lives searching the Matrix, looking for him."
12742,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"I did what I did, because I believe we have been brought here for a reason, Neo. You are here to serve a purpose, just as I am here to serve mine."
12743,Matrix-The,NEO,I told you I don't believe in fate.
12744,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"But I do, Neo. I do."
12745,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Get some rest. You're going to need it.
12746,Matrix-The,NEO,For what?
12747,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Your training.
12748,Matrix-The,NEO,No.
12749,Matrix-The,NEO,You don't have...
12750,Matrix-The,NEO,Zion?
12751,Matrix-The,NEO,Jiujitsu? I'm going to learn jujitsu?
12752,Matrix-The,NEO,No way.
12753,Matrix-The,NEO,Holy shit!
12754,Matrix-The,NEO,Hell yes!
12755,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,How is he?
12756,Matrix-The,NEO,This is incredible. I know Kung Fu.
12757,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Show me.
12758,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"This is a sparring program, similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix. Consider this your first lesson."
12759,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Attack me.
12760,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Good. Adaption. Improvisation. But your weakness isn't your technique.
12761,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,How did I beat you?
12762,Matrix-The,NEO,You -- You're too fast.
12763,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?"
12764,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Do you believe that's air you are breathing now?
12765,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"If you can free your mind, the body will follow."
12766,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Again.
12767,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,You are angry with me.
12768,Matrix-The,NEO,"I, uh... maybe."
12769,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,It's all right. It's natural.
12770,Matrix-The,NEO,I feel better.
12771,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Good, good. Anger is a gift, Neo, but it's a heavy one."
12772,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Tank, load the jump program."
12773,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,You have to learn to let go of that anger. You must let go of everything.
12774,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,You must empty yourself to free your mind.
12775,Matrix-The,NEO,Shit.
12776,Matrix-The,NEO,Okie dokie.
12777,Matrix-The,NEO,Yeah. Free my mind. Right. No problem.
12778,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Everyone falls the first time.
12779,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"If you never know failure, how can you know success?"
12780,Matrix-The,NEO,I thought it wasn't real.
12781,Matrix-The,NEO,"If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?"
12782,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,The body cannot live without the mind.
12783,Matrix-The,NEO,Sorry.
12784,Matrix-The,NEO,What are you doing?
12785,Matrix-The,NEO,Is that... ?
12786,Matrix-The,NEO,"Jeez, I was wondering about that."
12787,Matrix-The,NEO,Why I was bald here but not in the Matrix.
12788,Matrix-The,NEO,Residual self image.
12789,Matrix-The,NEO,"Life systems monitor, glucose levels."
12790,Matrix-The,NEO,Main power supply to the core.
12791,Matrix-The,NEO,Mainframe self-destruct. Uses all remaining power to generate an... E.M.P?
12792,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,How's he doing?
12793,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Good. I want everyone alerted to 12-hour stand-by. We're going in. Neo, it's time for you to know why you're here."
12794,Matrix-The,NEO,What's he talking about?
12795,Matrix-The,NEO,See who?
12796,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,We're in.
12797,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Mouse and Cable hold the exit. Let's go.
12798,Matrix-The,NEO,Did you have to do this?
12799,Matrix-The,NEO,What did she tell you?
12800,Matrix-The,NEO,Any of them true?
12801,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,We should be back in an hour.
12802,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Do you now understand what it means when we say, if you're not one of us, you're one of them?"
12803,Matrix-The,NEO,The agents. They're sentient programs. They can commandeer any software hardwired to the mainframe.
12804,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Anyone that is still in a power plant. That is why we try to be invisible in the Matrix.
12805,Matrix-The,NEO,The best hacking is always traceless.
12806,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"You're looking well, Mojo."
12807,Matrix-The,NEO,What -- what happened?
12808,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,This is the temple. It is a part of Zion's mainframe. It's hidden inside the Matrix so that we can access it.
12809,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Okay, you're on your own. Go with them."
12810,Matrix-The,NEO,There is no spoon. Right.
12811,Matrix-The,NEO,Hello?
12812,Matrix-The,NEO,Hello?
12813,Matrix-The,NEO,You're the Oracle?
12814,Matrix-The,NEO,Yeah.
12815,Matrix-The,NEO,What vase?
12816,Matrix-The,NEO,"Shit, I'm sorry."
12817,Matrix-The,NEO,How did you know...?
12818,Matrix-The,NEO,Who?
12819,Matrix-The,NEO,I think so.
12820,Matrix-The,NEO,I don't know.
12821,Matrix-The,NEO,What's the good news?
12822,Matrix-The,NEO,"Is that it, then?"
12823,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"You don't have to tell me anything, Neo, because I already know what she said."
12824,Matrix-The,NEO,You do?
12825,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,I brought you so that you could hear it for yourself. I knew it would help.
12826,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,No one will ever ask you because it is a gift from her. It is for you and you alone.
12827,Matrix-The,NEO,Whoa. Deja vu.
12828,Matrix-The,NEO,Nothing. Just had a little deja vu.
12829,Matrix-The,NEO,A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
12830,Matrix-The,NEO,It might have been. I'm not sure.
12831,Matrix-The,NEO,What is it?
12832,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Come on!
12833,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Give me your phone.
12834,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,We have no choice.
12835,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Tank, find a structural drawing of this building and find it fast."
12836,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,I need the main wet-wall.
12837,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Good.
12838,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Come on!
12839,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,You have to get Neo out. Understand? That's all that matters now.
12840,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,He must get out. Do you understand me?
12841,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,And you are?
12842,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,You all look the same to me.
12843,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"Oh, so have I."
12844,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,I already have.
12845,Matrix-The,NEO,I don't know. It just went dead.
12846,Matrix-The,NEO,It's Tank! He's alive.
12847,Matrix-The,NEO,Yeah. Right.
12848,Matrix-The,NEO,What are they doing to him?
12849,Matrix-The,NEO,How?
12850,Matrix-The,NEO,How much time?
12851,Matrix-The,NEO,The access codes to Zion.
12852,Matrix-The,NEO,You need help. I'm coming with you.
12853,Matrix-The,NEO,Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something that I'm not.
12854,Matrix-The,NEO,"I'm not the One, Trinity. The Oracle told me."
12855,Matrix-The,NEO,She said I had a gift but I still had a lot to learn. She told me maybe next life.
12856,Matrix-The,NEO,Why? It wouldn't mean anything. He'd still believe what he wanted to believe. But Morpheus is the one that matters. He's more important than me and we both know it.
12857,Matrix-The,NEO,"I may not be what Morpheus thinks I am, but if I don't try to help him, then I'm not even what I think I am."
12858,Matrix-The,NEO,His friend.
12859,Matrix-The,NEO,Yeah?
12860,Matrix-The,NEO,That's why it's going to work.
12861,Matrix-The,NEO,There is no spoon.
12862,Matrix-The,NEO,Trinity!
12863,Matrix-The,NEO,... help.
12864,Matrix-The,NEO,Thanks.
12865,Matrix-The,NEO,I'm fine.
12866,Matrix-The,NEO,Can you fly that thing?
12867,Matrix-The,NEO,"Get up, Morpheus! Get up!"
12868,Matrix-The,NEO,He won't make it.
12869,Matrix-The,NEO,Gotcha!
12870,Matrix-The,NEO,Oh fuck.
12871,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,I knew it! I goddamn knew it!
12872,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Do you believe me now? He's the One! Who else could have done this?
12873,Matrix-The,NEO,"Morpheus, I know you won't believe me but the Oracle told ne I'm not the One."
12874,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,It doesn't matter if I don't believe you --
12875,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,What matters is that you don't believe her.
12876,Matrix-The,NEO,Don't!
12877,Matrix-The,NEO,Get outta here. Okay? Run! Go!
12878,Matrix-The,NEO,It was nobody.
12879,Matrix-The,NEO,"Let's go! You first, Morpheus."
12880,Matrix-The,NEO,I believe...
12881,Matrix-The,NEO,I want to kiss you.
12882,Matrix-The,NEO,So are you.
12883,Matrix-The,NEO,I already have.
12884,Matrix-The,NEO,My name is Neo.
12885,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,"I know. Don't worry, he'll make it."
12886,Matrix-The,NEO,"Mr. Wizard, Get me the fuck out of here!"
12887,Matrix-The,NEO,"Hurry, Tank! I got some serious pursuit!"
12888,Matrix-The,NEO,"I'm trying, Trinity. I'm trying."
12889,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,Do it!
12890,Matrix-The,MORPHEUS,He's going to make it.
12891,Matrix-The,NEO,Hi. It's me. I know you're out there. I know you're working as fast as you can to catch me.
12892,Matrix-The,NEO,I thought I should call and let you know how things stand.
12893,Matrix-The,NEO,"I know you're real proud of this world you've built, the way it works, all the nice little rules and such, but I've got some bad news."
12894,Matrix-The,NEO,I've decided to make a few changes.
12895,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate's life for me Yo, ho, yo, ho, it's a pirate's life for me..."
12896,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"...drink up me hearties, yo, ho..."
12897,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
12898,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Actually, I find it all fascinating."
12899,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Yes, father."
12900,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,I still think it would be exciting to meet a pirate...
12901,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Look! A boy! In the water!
12902,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Boy overboard!
12903,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,My name is Elizabeth Swann.
12904,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"I'm watching over you, Will."
12905,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,You're a pirate.
12906,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
12907,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Yes -- yes.
12908,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Ceremony?
12909,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,I knew it.
12910,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Difficult ... to say.
12911,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Women in London must have learned to not breath.
12912,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Will! It's so good to see you!
12913,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"I dreamt about you last night. Will reacts with surprise: ""Really?"
12914,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,About the day we met. Do you remember?
12915,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?"
12916,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Good day, Mr. Turner."
12917,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,It's remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
12918,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"What do you say to three shillings, and we forget the name?"
12919,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Sorry, I didn't know."
12920,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh? You two weren't invited?"
12921,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,This must be some important boat.
12922,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Ship.
12923,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that -- -- makes this one here just a wee superfluous."
12924,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"That so? I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, nigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?"
12925,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,I'm sorry. It's just such a pretty boat. Ship.
12926,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Smith.
12927,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"None? Very well. You've rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go out on the account, do a little honest pirating."
12928,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't believe the truth if he told it to you."
12929,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,I can't breathe.
12930,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Aren't you going to save her?
12931,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Sailors.
12932,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Fine.
12933,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Don't lose these.
12934,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Clearly, you've never been to Singapore."
12935,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Where did you get this?
12936,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Yes -- yes, I'm fine -- Commodore Norrington, do you intend to kill my rescuer?"
12937,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Captain Jack Sparrow. If you please.
12938,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Ah, but you have heard of me."
12939,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Commodore, I must protest. Pirate or not, this man saved my life."
12940,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
12941,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Finally.
12942,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Commodore Norrington ... my pistol and belt, please."
12943,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Commodore!
12944,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Elizabeth -- it is Elizabeth?
12945,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?"
12946,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Now, if you'll be very kind?"
12947,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,You are despicable.
12948,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,I saved your life; now you've saved mine. We're square.
12949,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Gentleman. .. m' lady. .. you will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow.
12950,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine! Go capture him."
12951,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Thank you, Father ... and let that be the last of your fashion advice, please."
12952,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
12953,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Ah. Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. So if you'll excuse me ...
12954,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?"
12955,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Only a little.
12956,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"You know what you're doing, I'll give you that ... Excellent form ... But how's your footwork? If I step here -"
12957,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Very good! And if I step again, you step again. . ."
12958,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Ta!
12959,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"That's a good trick. Except, once again, you are between me and the way out. And now you have no weapon."
12960,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Who makes all these?
12961,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,You need to find yourself a girl. Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
12962,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Move away.
12963,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Move!
12964,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"You're lucky, boy -- this shot's not meant for you."
12965,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Nice and toasty. Thank you, Estrellia."
12966,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"You can keep doing that forever, that dog's never going to move."
12967,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,I know those guns!
12968,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,It's the Black Pearl.
12969,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,There are a lot of stories about the Black Pearl.
12970,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Listen, Estrella -- they haven't seen you. Hide, and first chance, run for the fort ."
12971,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Please, no ..."
12972,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Par. .. Parlay!
12973,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Parlay! I invoke the right of parlay! According to"" the Code of the Brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!"
12974,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"If an adversary demands parley, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete."
12975,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"It's all right, doggie ... come here,"
12976,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"What's the matter, boy?"
12977,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Worry about your own fortunes. The lowest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers ... and mutineers.
12978,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,You are cursed.
12979,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,The stories are true.
12980,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,I am here to --
12981,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
12982,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,I want you to leave. And never come back.
12983,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Very well.
12984,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,I'll drop it!
12985,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Because it's what you're searching for. You've been searching for it for years. I recognize this ship.
12986,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Fine. I suppose if this is worthless, there's no reason to keep it."
12987,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Elizabeth - Turner. I'm a maid in the governor's household. Barbossa reacts to the name Turner: it confirms what he has suspected. The other pirates surreptitiously exchange glances and nods.
12988,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Thank you, sir."
12989,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Of course. I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean."
12990,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Can I trust you?
12991,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Our bargain. . ?
12992,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Wait! You must return me to shore! According to the rules of the Order of the Brethren -
12993,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Somewhat.
12994,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
12995,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Why ask me?
12996,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,And you want to turn pirate yourself?
12997,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone. I see no profit in it for me."
12998,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,How? The key's run off.
12999,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Your name is Turner.
13000,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Will Turner... I'll tell you what, Mr. Turner. I've changed my mind. You spring me from this cell, and on pain of death, I'll you to the Black Pearl. Do we have an accord?"
13001,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Agreed!
13002,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Not without my effects.
13003,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"My business, Will. As for your business -one question, or there's no use going. This girl -- what does she mean to you? How far are you willing to go to save her?"
13004,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Good.
13005,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Ah, now there's a lovely sight!"
13006,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"I knew the Harbormaster wouldn't report her. Honest men are slaves to their conscience, and there's no predicting 'em. But you can always trust a dishonest man to stay that way..."
13007,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Come aboard.
13008,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,No worries there. She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
13009,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Besides, we are about to better our prospects considerably."
13010,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Commandeer. We're going to commandeer a ship. Nautical term.
13011,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
13012,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Everybody stay calm. We're taking over the ship!
13013,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Dead serious.
13014,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,We'll see about that.
13015,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Fine by me. We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound."
13016,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"As likely as not. Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!"
13017,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,A little help?
13018,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Lookee there, mate! We're underway!"
13019,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Can you swim? Can. You. Swim?
13020,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Good.
13021,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Thank you, Commodore, for getting our ship ready to make way! We'd've had a hard time of it by ourselves!"
13022,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
13023,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,It's poisoned!
13024,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Then why aren't you eating?
13025,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,It's a pirate medallion.
13026,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"That's all very interesting, but I hardly believe in ghost stories any more."
13027,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study."
13028,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Is that so?
13029,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"I knew him. Probably one of the few who knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill."
13030,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Good man. Good pirate. And clever -""- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin."
13031,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"I swear, you look just like him."
13032,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
13033,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable"
13034,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
13035,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Put it away, Will. It's not worth getting beat again."
13036,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?"
13037,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,What a man can do. And what a man can I t do.
13038,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"For instance: you can accept that your father was a pirate and still a good man... or you can't. Now me, I can sail this ship to Tortuga, by myself. . . But I can't just let you drown."
13039,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
13040,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Don't worry. I've already got my Quartermaster -- there!
13041,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,AnaMaria! Have you seen Gibbs? I need to put together -
13042,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Borrowed. Borrowed your boat. Without permission.
13043,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Safe! At Port Royal. With the Royal Navy.
13044,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,You'll get it back. Or one better.
13045,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition."
13046,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Just the one.
13047,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?"
13048,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,I'm going after the Black Pearl.
13049,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Ilm going after the Black Pearl. I know where its going to be, and I'm going to take it."
13050,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a crew."
13051,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Back there, guarding the door is the son of old Bootstrap Bill Turner."
13052,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,That he is.
13053,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Mr. Cotton. Do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true, in the face danger, and almost certain death?"
13054,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,These are the only ones worth having. And we're going to need them-
13055,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,She can hold a bit longer.
13056,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,We're catching up!
13057,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Bear three points starboard.
13058,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Six points port!
13059,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,I didn't!
13060,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"My body's still there, rotting away, and I am but a ghost!"
13061,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold."
13062,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"The pistol. When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot. No good for hunting, or surviving, really. But after three weeks of starvation and thirst -- the option of that pistol begins to look good."
13063,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,But I survived. And I still have that single shot. It's meant for one man. My mutinous first mate -
13064,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"They'll be anchored on the lee side. Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island -"
13065,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,The curse drove you to gather this?
13066,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Depends.
13067,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"On whether the stories are all true. If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon. If not -"
13068,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"-- well, too late."
13069,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Chalk one up for the stories.
13070,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,No.
13071,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,You?!
13072,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Me!
13073,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,You're in league with Barbossa!
13074,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"No, I'm -- rescuing you."
13075,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,You?!
13076,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,This way!
13077,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
13078,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"The trick isn't getting here, it's getting away."
13079,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Come on!
13080,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,I'll lead them away.
13081,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship. I'll keep 'em busy."
13082,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"I'm sure. When you've led the kind of life I have, there are debts that must be paid. Maybe I can balance the scales a little."
13083,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"I invoke the right of parlay, according to the Code of the Brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew..."
13084,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"The woman's blood didn't work, did it?"
13085,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"I know who's blood you need, to end the curse."
13086,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,No you won't.
13087,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Simple. I have something you want more than anything. The way to free you from the curse of the treasure. You have something I want -- more than anything.
13088,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,You give me the Pearl. Then I tell you who you need.
13089,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,That's right.
13090,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,I'm a man of my word.
13091,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse. Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice."
13092,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
13093,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Wait as long as you like.
13094,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Let's say I tell you the wrong person. What would you do?
13095,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"And if I tell you the truth, you become mortal, and you won't come near me because you know I'd kill you."
13096,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want."
13097,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,What -- you don't have the medallion?
13098,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,I'll watch my back.
13099,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"... you were in danger ... so I took the medallion. And I've kept it ever since. They thought I was you, that they needed my blood. And it didn't work."
13100,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"To keep it away from them? No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock."
13101,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,-- then we never would have met.
13102,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
13103,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Don't hit my ship! I mean, kill the lying scoundrel - I'm a little conflicted, here."
13104,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,No!
13105,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Will -- you can't trust him.
13106,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime. No good can come of it."
13107,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Someone needs to cut these bonds, then."
13108,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"The last time you did this, you left me a pistol, with one shot."
13109,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"A gentleman might give us two pistols, seeing as there are two of us, this time."
13110,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,You can go to your grave not knowing.
13111,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Here -- it will go well with your black heart !
13112,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,I will not walk into the ocean. You'll have to throw me in!
13113,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,You went back for that? We need to head for the reef!
13114,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,That's the second time I've had to watch that man sail away with my ship.
13115,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Not all that big, is it?"
13116,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Has it changed since the last time you were here?
13117,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,The trees are taller.
13118,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,I hope you have no intention of using that.
13119,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Not yet. Ask me again in a few weeks.
13120,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Captain Sparrow! We have to get off this island -- immediately!
13121,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,What is that? Is there a boat under there?
13122,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,What? What's wrong? How will this help us get off the island?
13123,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"It won't. It won't, and so we won't."
13124,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,But ... you did it before! Last time -
13125,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Last time, I was here a grand total of three days. Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off."
13126,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"But from the looks of this, they've long been'out of business, and so that won't be happening again. We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that."
13127,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,So that's it? That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous
13128,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Welcome to the Caribbean, love."
13129,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord. We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again. And we've got rum, praise the Lord. We can stay alive a month, maybe more. Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair."
13130,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,A month? Will doesn't have a month! We've got to do something to help him!
13131,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"You're right. Here's luck to you, Will Turner."
13132,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth. But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about."
13133,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Not when you can drink instead, at least."
13134,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,And you will call me Miss Swann.
13135,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Drink up me hearties, yo ho..."
13136,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"What? What was that? Something funny, Miss Swann? share. Please,"
13137,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Nothing ... it's nothing. Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child. A song about pirates.
13138,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child. Let's hear it."
13139,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Oh, no ... it's silly. Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really. They seemed so romantic and daring -"
13140,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"That was before I met one, of course."
13141,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ..."
13142,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,More to drink!
13143,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Well?
13144,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, we loot, Drink up me hearties, yo ho."
13145,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"We kidnap and ravage and we don't give a hoot, Drink up me hearties, yo ho -"
13146,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"I LOVE this song! Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me! We're beggars and blighters,"
13147,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!"
13148,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
13149,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Not just the Spanish Main. The whole ocean. .. the whole world. Wherever we want to go, we go. That's what a ship is, you know. Not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails. That's what a ship need_ ... but what a ship is -- what the Black Pearl really-is ... is freedom."
13150,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again."
13151,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Ah, well... the company is better than last time. And the scenery has definitely improved."
13152,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
13153,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,To freedom.
13154,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,To the Black Pearl.
13155,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"What are you doing? You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!"
13156,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Yes, the rum is gone."
13157,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two -"
13158,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction. The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could mass it?"
13159,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?"
13160,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Exactly.
13161,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Just you wait, Captain. In an hour, maybe two, keep a 'weather eye open' and you'll be seeing white sails on that horizon!"
13162,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
13163,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,We had time to get to know each other.
13164,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,No. The pirates have taken Will -
13165,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Commodore, please!"
13166,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me. As a wedding gift."
13167,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Not as a condition -- a request.
13168,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Congratulations, sir."
13169,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,What?
13170,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"And now I know... where yours does, as well."
13171,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,Then I can wear men's clothing.
13172,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Well, I am not going to stay hidden in a some cabin, 80 I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare ankles for the remainder of the voyage!"
13173,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
13174,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Nor did you, I noticed."
13175,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
13176,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Exactly.
13177,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
13178,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"I have a plan. If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided."
13179,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,What's your plan?
13180,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Funny, I was thinking along those lines. How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you."
13181,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,They left me stranded. Twice. What have you got to lose?
13182,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,I knew you'd listen to reason!
13183,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"That chart I drew up'11 get you past the reefs. If you're steersman's good enough, that is."
13184,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them."
13185,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Do you have any idea where you're going?
13186,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Don't talk. These caves magnify sound. Just follow me.
13187,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,It's the right way.
13188,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,You don't want to be doing that.
13189,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,All right then.
13190,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor."
13191,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,- - and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
13192,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal."
13193,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Simple. Don't kill the boy yet. Wait for a more opportune moment.
13194,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Like after you've killed... Every... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
13195,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,The situation has changed.
13196,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Aye. See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do? Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue? The Dauntless a first-rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas."
13197,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"I sail for you as part of your fleet, I give you fifteen percent of my plunder, and you get to introduce yourself at tea parties and brothels as 'Commodore Barbossa.' Do we have an accord?"
13198,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?"
13199,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,There's ... another exit?
13200,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Oh, please -- do I really seem that clever?"
13201,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Use it well.
13202,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
13203,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Well, isn't that interesting."
13204,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"They're so pretty, I just couldn't resist stealing one. It's a curse, I guess."
13205,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Or you could surrender.
13206,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"The worst. On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants. Now that's a great pirate."
13207,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,You're all right!
13208,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,"Yes, I am wearing trousers. And as for how we got off the island -- ah, that's a grand adventure, but now is not the time to talk about it."
13209,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,There. And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
13210,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,ELIZABETH,It doesn't!
13211,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,Tough luck. I was rooting for you.
13212,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!"
13213,Pirates-of-the-Caribbean,JACK,"Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail - you and Cotton. I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and-span and ship-shape!"
13214,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,What is that you're ripping? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10.
13215,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,I agree with Fezzik.
13216,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"That Vizzini, he can fuss."
13217,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Probably he means no harm.
13218,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme."
13219,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?"
13220,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Making sure nobody's following us.
13221,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,You're sure nobody's following us?
13222,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there."
13223,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,I don't swim. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15.
13224,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,I think he's getting closer.
13225,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
13226,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
13227,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means. My God! He's climbing.
13228,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,I want to duel him left-handed.
13229,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly."
13230,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Hello there.
13231,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Slow going?
13232,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Sorry.
13233,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,I do not suppose you could speed things up?
13234,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you."
13235,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
13236,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
13237,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,You don't know any way you'll trust me?
13238,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"I swear on the soul of my father, Domingo Montoya, you will reach the top alive."
13239,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,We'll wait until you're ready.
13240,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"I do not mean to pry, but you don't by any chance happen to have six fingers on your right hand?"
13241,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done."
13242,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"The six-fingered man returned and demanded it, but at one-tenth his promised price. My father refused. Without a word, the six-fingered man slashed him through the heart. I loved my father, so, naturally, challenged his murderer to a duel ... I failed ... --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 29."
13243,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"the six-fingered man did leave me alive with the six-fingered sword, but he gave me these."
13244,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."""
13245,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge."
13246,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"You are ready, then?"
13247,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
13248,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Begin!
13249,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"You're using Bonetti's defense against me, ah? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 31."
13250,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro."
13251,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Unless the enemy has studied his Agrippa-
13252,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,-- which I have.
13253,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,You are wonderful!
13254,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,I admit it -- you are better than I am.
13255,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Because I know something you don't know.
13256,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,I am not left-handed.
13257,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,I ought to be after twenty years.
13258,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Tell me.
13259,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Who are you?!
13260,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,I must know.
13261,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Okay.
13262,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Kill me quickly.
13263,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"I am waiting for you, Vizzini. You told me to go back to the beginning. So I have. This is where I am, and this is where I'll stay. I will not be moved."
13264,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"I do not budge. Keep your ""Ho there."""
13265,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"-- So did Vizzini -- when a job went wrong, you went back to the beginning. And this is where we got the job. So it's the beginning, and I'm staying till Vizzini comes."
13266,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,-- I -- am -- waiting -- for -- Vizzini -- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 80.
13267,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,It's you.
13268,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Perhaps not. I feel fine.
13269,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,That's enough. That's enough! Where is this Rugen so I may kill him?
13270,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,How many could you handle?
13271,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many. I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 82."
13272,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
13273,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --"
13274,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"To find the Man in Black, obviously."
13275,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace."
13276,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,There will be blood tonight!!
13277,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering? Excuse me --"
13278,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"-- pardon me, it's important --"
13279,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"-- Fezzik, please --"
13280,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Thank you.
13281,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Where is the Man in Black?
13282,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"You get there from this grove, yes?"
13283,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"Fezzik, jog his memory."
13284,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"Father, I have failed you for twenty years. Now our misery can end. Somewhere ... somewhere close by is a man who can help us. I cannot find him alone. I need you. I need you to guide my sword. Please."
13285,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Guide my sword.
13286,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,It just is not fair.
13287,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body."
13288,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Have you any money?
13289,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 91."
13290,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
13291,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,We need a miracle. It's very important. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 92.
13292,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,He's already dead.
13293,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Sir. Sir.
13294,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,We're really in a terrible rush.
13295,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Sixty-five.
13296,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"This is noble, sir. His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation."
13297,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years."
13298,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,He's dead. He can't talk.
13299,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,What's that?
13300,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
13301,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"-- But this is Buttercup's true love -- If you heal him, he will stop Humperdinck's wedding."
13302,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Humiliations galore!
13303,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,That's a miracle pill?
13304,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Thank you for everything.
13305,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,What's the difference? We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
13306,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
13307,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
13308,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Your guess is as good as mine --
13309,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
13310,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"Let me explain -- -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 99."
13311,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen."
13312,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,There is but one working castle gate.
13313,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,And it is guarded by sixty men.
13314,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel."
13315,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
13316,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,There we cannot help you.
13317,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Where did you get that?
13318,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Why? You can't even lift one.
13319,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --"
13320,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"Right, right, sorry."
13321,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,What?
13322,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Now?
13323,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Now?
13324,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"Fezzik, tear his arms off."
13325,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
13326,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"Fezzik, I need you --"
13327,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!"
13328,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Thank you --
13329,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"... Sorry, Father ... I tried ... I tried..."
13330,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father; prepare to die."
13331,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die."
13332,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
13333,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,HELLO! MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA. YOU KILLED MY FATHER. PREPARE TO
13334,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,-- offer me money --
13335,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,-- power too -- promise me that --
13336,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,-- offer me everything I ask for --
13337,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!"
13338,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Where's Fezzik?
13339,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,No.
13340,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Help him.
13341,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Because he has no strength --
13342,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,Shall I dispatch him for you?
13343,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"FEZZIK, you did something right. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 122."
13344,Princess-Bride-The,INIGO,"You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life."
13345,Shrek,SHREK,"Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin."
13346,Shrek,SHREK,"They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast."
13347,Shrek,SHREK,"This is the part where you run away. And stay out! ""Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."""
13348,Shrek,DONKEY,"Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance!"
13349,Shrek,DONKEY,Oh!
13350,Shrek,DONKEY,Hey! I can fly!
13351,Shrek,DONKEY,"Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! Uh-oh."
13352,Shrek,SHREK,Aye?
13353,Shrek,SHREK,"Oh, really? You and what army?"
13354,Shrek,DONKEY,"Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible!"
13355,Shrek,SHREK,Are you talkin' to... me? Whoa!
13356,Shrek,DONKEY,"Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that."
13357,Shrek,SHREK,"Oh, that's great. Really."
13358,Shrek,DONKEY,"Man, it's good to be free."
13359,Shrek,SHREK,"Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?"
13360,Shrek,DONKEY,"But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us."
13361,Shrek,DONKEY,"Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time... ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day."
13362,Shrek,SHREK,Why are you following me?
13363,Shrek,DONKEY,"I'll tell you why. 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith..."
13364,Shrek,SHREK,Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends.
13365,Shrek,DONKEY,Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.
13366,Shrek,SHREK,"Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?"
13367,Shrek,DONKEY,Uh ...really tall?
13368,Shrek,SHREK,"No! I'm an ogre! You know. ""Grab your torch and pitchforks."" Doesn't that bother you?"
13369,Shrek,DONKEY,Nope.
13370,Shrek,SHREK,Really?
13371,Shrek,DONKEY,"Really, really."
13372,Shrek,SHREK,Oh.
13373,Shrek,DONKEY,"Man, I like you. What's you name?"
13374,Shrek,SHREK,"Uh, Shrek."
13375,Shrek,DONKEY,"Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that?"
13376,Shrek,SHREK,That would be my home.
13377,Shrek,DONKEY,"Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you?"
13378,Shrek,SHREK,I like my privacy.
13379,Shrek,DONKEY,"You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. Can I stay with you?"
13380,Shrek,SHREK,"Uh, what?"
13381,Shrek,DONKEY,"Can I stay with you, please?"
13382,Shrek,SHREK,Of course!
13383,Shrek,DONKEY,Really?
13384,Shrek,SHREK,No.
13385,Shrek,DONKEY,"Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!"
13386,Shrek,SHREK,Okay! Okay! But one night only.
13387,Shrek,DONKEY,Ah! Thank you!
13388,Shrek,SHREK,What are you...? No! No!
13389,Shrek,DONKEY,"This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles."
13390,Shrek,SHREK,Oh!
13391,Shrek,DONKEY,"Where do, uh, I sleep?"
13392,Shrek,SHREK,Outside!
13393,Shrek,DONKEY,"Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me..."
13394,Shrek,SHREK,I thought I told you to stay outside.
13395,Shrek,DONKEY,I am outside.
13396,Shrek,SHREK,Got ya.
13397,Shrek,SHREK,Ow!
13398,Shrek,SHREK,"Enough! What are you doing in my house? Hey! Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table."
13399,Shrek,SHREK,Huh?
13400,Shrek,SHREK,"I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? Oh, no. No! No!"
13401,Shrek,SHREK,What are you doing in my swamp?
13402,Shrek,SHREK,"All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. Oh!"
13403,Shrek,DONKEY,"Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them."
13404,Shrek,SHREK,What?
13405,Shrek,SHREK,By who?
13406,Shrek,SHREK,All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?
13407,Shrek,DONKEY,"Oh, I do. I know where he is."
13408,Shrek,SHREK,Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all?
13409,Shrek,DONKEY,Me! Me!
13410,Shrek,SHREK,Anyone?
13411,Shrek,DONKEY,"Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!"
13412,Shrek,SHREK,"Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! Oh! You! You're comin' with me."
13413,Shrek,DONKEY,"All right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it!"
13414,Shrek,DONKEY,"On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again."
13415,Shrek,SHREK,What did I say about singing?
13416,Shrek,DONKEY,Can I whistle?
13417,Shrek,SHREK,No.
13418,Shrek,DONKEY,Can I hum it?
13419,Shrek,SHREK,"All right, hum it."
13420,Shrek,DONKEY,But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.
13421,Shrek,SHREK,"So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle."
13422,Shrek,DONKEY,Uh-huh. That's the place.
13423,Shrek,SHREK,Do you think maybe he's compensating for something?
13424,Shrek,DONKEY,"Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek."
13425,Shrek,SHREK,"Hey, you! Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - -"
13426,Shrek,SHREK,It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?
13427,Shrek,DONKEY,"Hey, look at this!"
13428,Shrek,DONKEY,Wow! Let's do that again!
13429,Shrek,SHREK,"No. No. No, no, no! No."
13430,Shrek,SHREK,All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom.
13431,Shrek,DONKEY,Sorry about that.
13432,Shrek,SHREK,"Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey."
13433,Shrek,SHREK,"Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now."
13434,Shrek,SHREK,Can't we just settle this over a pint?
13435,Shrek,SHREK,No? All right then. Come on!
13436,Shrek,DONKEY,"Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!"
13437,Shrek,SHREK,Yeah!
13438,Shrek,SHREK,"Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha!"
13439,Shrek,SHREK,What?
13440,Shrek,SHREK,"Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back."
13441,Shrek,SHREK,"Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures!"
13442,Shrek,SHREK,Exactly the way it was?
13443,Shrek,SHREK,And the squatters?
13444,Shrek,SHREK,What kind of quest?
13445,Shrek,DONKEY,Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right?
13446,Shrek,SHREK,"You know, maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk."
13447,Shrek,DONKEY,"I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip."
13448,Shrek,SHREK,"Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?"
13449,Shrek,DONKEY,"Uh, no, not really, no."
13450,Shrek,SHREK,"For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think."
13451,Shrek,DONKEY,Example?
13452,Shrek,SHREK,"Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions."
13453,Shrek,DONKEY,They stink?
13454,Shrek,SHREK,Yes - - No!
13455,Shrek,DONKEY,They make you cry?
13456,Shrek,SHREK,No!
13457,Shrek,DONKEY,"You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs."
13458,Shrek,SHREK,No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers.
13459,Shrek,DONKEY,"Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers."
13460,Shrek,SHREK,I don't care... what everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes.
13461,Shrek,DONKEY,"You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you say, ""Let's get some parfait,"" they say, ""Hell no, I don't like no parfait""? Parfaits are delicious."
13462,Shrek,SHREK,"No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later."
13463,Shrek,DONKEY,Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.
13464,Shrek,SHREK,"You know, I think I preferred your humming."
13465,Shrek,DONKEY,Do you have a tissue or something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start slobbering.
13466,Shrek,DONKEY,Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was open and everything.
13467,Shrek,SHREK,"Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. It's brimstone. We must be getting close."
13468,Shrek,DONKEY,"Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone neither."
13469,Shrek,SHREK,"Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location."
13470,Shrek,DONKEY,"Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said ogres have layers?"
13471,Shrek,SHREK,"Oh, aye."
13472,Shrek,DONKEY,"Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves."
13473,Shrek,SHREK,Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.
13474,Shrek,DONKEY,You know what I mean.
13475,Shrek,SHREK,You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.
13476,Shrek,DONKEY,"No, I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava!"
13477,Shrek,SHREK,"Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time."
13478,Shrek,DONKEY,Really?
13479,Shrek,SHREK,"Really, really."
13480,Shrek,DONKEY,"Okay, that makes me feel so much better."
13481,Shrek,SHREK,Just keep moving. And don't look down.
13482,Shrek,DONKEY,"Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't look down. Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, please!"
13483,Shrek,SHREK,But you're already halfway.
13484,Shrek,DONKEY,But I know that half is safe!
13485,Shrek,SHREK,"Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back."
13486,Shrek,DONKEY,"Shrek, no! Wait!"
13487,Shrek,SHREK,"Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me?"
13488,Shrek,DONKEY,Don't do that!
13489,Shrek,SHREK,"Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this?"
13490,Shrek,DONKEY,"Yes, that!"
13491,Shrek,SHREK,"Yes? Yes, do it. Okay."
13492,Shrek,DONKEY,"No, Shrek! No! Stop it!"
13493,Shrek,SHREK,You said do it! I'm doin' it.
13494,Shrek,DONKEY,"I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. Oh!"
13495,Shrek,SHREK,"That'll do, Donkey. That'll do."
13496,Shrek,DONKEY,Cool. So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?
13497,Shrek,SHREK,"Inside, waiting for us to rescue her."
13498,Shrek,DONKEY,"I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek."
13499,Shrek,DONKEY,You afraid?
13500,Shrek,SHREK,No.
13501,Shrek,DONKEY,But...
13502,Shrek,SHREK,Shh.
13503,Shrek,DONKEY,"Oh, good. Me neither. 'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that."
13504,Shrek,SHREK,"Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs."
13505,Shrek,DONKEY,Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.
13506,Shrek,SHREK,The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.
13507,Shrek,DONKEY,What makes you think she'll be there?
13508,Shrek,SHREK,I read it in a book once.
13509,Shrek,DONKEY,Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way they're goin'.
13510,Shrek,DONKEY,I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here. I'd step all over it.
13511,Shrek,SHREK,"Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the..."
13512,Shrek,DONKEY,Dragon!
13513,Shrek,SHREK,"Donkey, look out! Got ya!"
13514,Shrek,DONKEY,Oh! Aah! Aah!
13515,Shrek,DONKEY,"No. Oh, no, No! Oh, what large teeth you have. I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile you got there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know what else? You're - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty. What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ohh. Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh... I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings. Shrek! No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!"
13516,Shrek,FIONA,Oh! Oh!
13517,Shrek,SHREK,Wake up!
13518,Shrek,FIONA,What?
13519,Shrek,SHREK,Are you Princess Fiona?
13520,Shrek,FIONA,"I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me."
13521,Shrek,SHREK,"Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!"
13522,Shrek,FIONA,"But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment?"
13523,Shrek,SHREK,"Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time."
13524,Shrek,FIONA,"Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should sweep me off my feet out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed."
13525,Shrek,SHREK,"You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?"
13526,Shrek,FIONA,Mm-hmm.
13527,Shrek,FIONA,But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!
13528,Shrek,SHREK,I don't think so.
13529,Shrek,FIONA,Can I at least know the name of my champion?
13530,Shrek,SHREK,"Uh, Shrek."
13531,Shrek,FIONA,Sir Shrek. I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
13532,Shrek,SHREK,Thanks!
13533,Shrek,FIONA,You didn't slay the dragon?
13534,Shrek,SHREK,It's on my to-do list. Now come on!
13535,Shrek,FIONA,"But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. That's what all the other knights did."
13536,Shrek,SHREK,"Yeah, right before they burst into flame."
13537,Shrek,FIONA,That's not the point. Oh! Wait. Where are you going? The exit's over there.
13538,Shrek,SHREK,"Well, I have to save my ass."
13539,Shrek,FIONA,What kind of knight are you?
13540,Shrek,SHREK,One of a kind.
13541,Shrek,DONKEY,"Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time. Just call me old-fashioned. I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - - Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals. I'm on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards - - I'd really love to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission - - What are you gonna do with that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh!"
13542,Shrek,DONKEY,"Hi, Princess!"
13543,Shrek,FIONA,It talks!
13544,Shrek,SHREK,"Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick."
13545,Shrek,SHREK,Oh!
13546,Shrek,SHREK,"Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon."
13547,Shrek,SHREK,Run!
13548,Shrek,FIONA,"You did it! You rescued me! You're amazing. You're - - You're wonderful. You're... a little unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed is great, and thy heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt. And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?"
13549,Shrek,DONKEY,I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.
13550,Shrek,FIONA,"The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight."
13551,Shrek,SHREK,"Uh, no."
13552,Shrek,FIONA,Why not?
13553,Shrek,SHREK,I have helmet hair.
13554,Shrek,FIONA,Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.
13555,Shrek,SHREK,"No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st."
13556,Shrek,FIONA,But how will you kiss me?
13557,Shrek,SHREK,What? That wasn't in the job description.
13558,Shrek,DONKEY,Maybe it's a perk.
13559,Shrek,FIONA,"No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss."
13560,Shrek,DONKEY,Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you true love?
13561,Shrek,FIONA,"Well, yes."
13562,Shrek,DONKEY,You think Shrek is your true love!
13563,Shrek,FIONA,What is so funny?
13564,Shrek,SHREK,"Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona: Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your helmet."
13565,Shrek,SHREK,Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.
13566,Shrek,FIONA,Just take off the helmet.
13567,Shrek,SHREK,I'm not going to.
13568,Shrek,FIONA,Take it off.
13569,Shrek,SHREK,No!
13570,Shrek,FIONA,Now!
13571,Shrek,SHREK,Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.
13572,Shrek,FIONA,You- - You're a- - an ogre.
13573,Shrek,SHREK,"Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming."
13574,Shrek,FIONA,"Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an ogre."
13575,Shrek,SHREK,"Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who wants to marry you."
13576,Shrek,FIONA,Then why didn't he come rescue me?
13577,Shrek,SHREK,Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.
13578,Shrek,FIONA,"But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some ogre and his- - his pet."
13579,Shrek,DONKEY,"Well, so much for noble steed."
13580,Shrek,SHREK,You're not making my job any easier.
13581,Shrek,FIONA,"I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here."
13582,Shrek,SHREK,"Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy."
13583,Shrek,FIONA,You wouldn't dare. Put me down!
13584,Shrek,SHREK,"Ya comin', Donkey?"
13585,Shrek,DONKEY,I'm right behind ya.
13586,Shrek,FIONA,"Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not dignified! Put me down!"
13587,Shrek,DONKEY,"Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten?"
13588,Shrek,FIONA,You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knows what happens when you find your... Hey! The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.
13589,Shrek,DONKEY,"You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!"
13590,Shrek,FIONA,And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?
13591,Shrek,SHREK,"Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply."
13592,Shrek,DONKEY,"I don't know. There are those who think little of him. Fiona: Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad."
13593,Shrek,SHREK,"Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. But I'll let you do the ""measuring"" when you see him tomorrow."
13594,Shrek,FIONA,Tomorrow? It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
13595,Shrek,SHREK,"No, that'll take longer. We can keep going."
13596,Shrek,FIONA,But there's robbers in the woods.
13597,Shrek,DONKEY,"Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting to sound good."
13598,Shrek,SHREK,"Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest."
13599,Shrek,FIONA,I need to find somewhere to camp now!
13600,Shrek,SHREK,Hey! Over here.
13601,Shrek,DONKEY,"Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a princess."
13602,Shrek,FIONA,"No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches."
13603,Shrek,SHREK,Homey touches? Like what?
13604,Shrek,FIONA,"A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night."
13605,Shrek,DONKEY,You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will.
13606,Shrek,FIONA,I said good night!
13607,Shrek,DONKEY,"Shrek, What are you doing?"
13608,Shrek,SHREK,"I just- - You know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding."
13609,Shrek,SHREK,"And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields."
13610,Shrek,DONKEY,"Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?"
13611,Shrek,SHREK,"The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for."
13612,Shrek,DONKEY,I know you're making this up.
13613,Shrek,SHREK,"No, look. There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench."
13614,Shrek,DONKEY,That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.
13615,Shrek,SHREK,"You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it."
13616,Shrek,DONKEY,"Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?"
13617,Shrek,SHREK,Our swamp?
13618,Shrek,DONKEY,"You know, when we're through rescuing the princess."
13619,Shrek,SHREK,"We? Donkey, there's no ""we"". There's no ""our"". There's just me and my swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall around my land."
13620,Shrek,DONKEY,"You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out."
13621,Shrek,SHREK,"No, do ya think?"
13622,Shrek,DONKEY,Are you hidin' something?
13623,Shrek,SHREK,"Never mind, Donkey."
13624,Shrek,DONKEY,"Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?"
13625,Shrek,SHREK,"No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things."
13626,Shrek,DONKEY,Why don't you want to talk about it?
13627,Shrek,SHREK,Why do you want to talk about it?
13628,Shrek,DONKEY,Why are you blocking?
13629,Shrek,SHREK,I'm not blocking.
13630,Shrek,DONKEY,"Oh, yes, you are."
13631,Shrek,SHREK,"Donkey, I'm warning you."
13632,Shrek,DONKEY,Who you trying to keep out?
13633,Shrek,SHREK,Everyone! Okay?
13634,Shrek,DONKEY,"Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere."
13635,Shrek,SHREK,Oh! For the love of Pete!
13636,Shrek,DONKEY,What's your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway?
13637,Shrek,SHREK,"Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. ""Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre!"" They judge me before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone."
13638,Shrek,DONKEY,"You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, stupid, ugly ogre."
13639,Shrek,SHREK,"Yeah, I know."
13640,Shrek,DONKEY,"So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?"
13641,Shrek,SHREK,"Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying."
13642,Shrek,DONKEY,"Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one there?"
13643,Shrek,SHREK,That's the moon.
13644,Shrek,DONKEY,"Oh, okay."
13645,Shrek,DONKEY,"Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that. Come on, baby. I said I like it."
13646,Shrek,SHREK,"Donkey, wake up."
13647,Shrek,DONKEY,Huh? What?
13648,Shrek,SHREK,Wake up.
13649,Shrek,DONKEY,What?
13650,Shrek,FIONA,"Good morning. Hm, how do you like your eggs?"
13651,Shrek,DONKEY,"Oh, good morning, Princess!"
13652,Shrek,SHREK,What's all this about?
13653,Shrek,FIONA,"You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me."
13654,Shrek,SHREK,"Uh, thanks."
13655,Shrek,FIONA,"Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us."
13656,Shrek,DONKEY,Shrek!
13657,Shrek,SHREK,"What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say."
13658,Shrek,DONKEY,"Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess."
13659,Shrek,FIONA,Thanks.
13660,Shrek,DONKEY,She's as nasty as you are.
13661,Shrek,SHREK,"You know, you're not exactly what I expected."
13662,Shrek,FIONA,"Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them."
13663,Shrek,SHREK,Princess!
13664,Shrek,FIONA,What are you doing?
13665,Shrek,SHREK,Hey! That's my princess! Go find you own!
13666,Shrek,FIONA,"Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are!"
13667,Shrek,FIONA,"Man, that was annoying!"
13668,Shrek,FIONA,"Uh, shall we?"
13669,Shrek,SHREK,"Hold the phone. Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from?"
13670,Shrek,FIONA,What?
13671,Shrek,SHREK,That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that?
13672,Shrek,FIONA,"Well... when one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these things in case there's a... there's an arrow in your butt!"
13673,Shrek,SHREK,"What? Oh, would you look at that?"
13674,Shrek,FIONA,"Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry."
13675,Shrek,DONKEY,Why? What's wrong?
13676,Shrek,FIONA,Shrek's hurt.
13677,Shrek,DONKEY,"Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die."
13678,Shrek,SHREK,"Donkey, I'm okay."
13679,Shrek,DONKEY,"You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep you legs elevated. Turn your head and cough. Does anyone know the Heimlich?"
13680,Shrek,FIONA,"Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns."
13681,Shrek,DONKEY,"Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!"
13682,Shrek,DONKEY,"Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns."
13683,Shrek,SHREK,What are the flowers for?
13684,Shrek,FIONA,For getting rid of Donkey.
13685,Shrek,SHREK,Ah.
13686,Shrek,FIONA,"Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out."
13687,Shrek,SHREK,Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin'.
13688,Shrek,FIONA,"I'm sorry, but it has to come out."
13689,Shrek,SHREK,"No, it's tender."
13690,Shrek,FIONA,"Now, hold on."
13691,Shrek,SHREK,What you're doing is the opposite of help.
13692,Shrek,FIONA,Don't move.
13693,Shrek,SHREK,"Look, time out."
13694,Shrek,FIONA,Would you... Okay. What do you propose we do?
13695,Shrek,DONKEY,"Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue flower, red thorns."
13696,Shrek,SHREK,Ow!
13697,Shrek,DONKEY,"Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'!"
13698,Shrek,SHREK,Ow! Not good.
13699,Shrek,FIONA,Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head. It's just about...
13700,Shrek,SHREK,Ow! Ohh!
13701,Shrek,DONKEY,Ahem.
13702,Shrek,SHREK,"Nothing happend. We were just, uh - -"
13703,Shrek,DONKEY,"Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask. Okay?"
13704,Shrek,SHREK,"Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was just- - Ugh! Ow!"
13705,Shrek,DONKEY,"Hey, what's that? That's...is that blood?"
13706,Shrek,SHREK,"There it is, Princess. Your future awaits you."
13707,Shrek,FIONA,That's DuLoc?
13708,Shrek,DONKEY,"Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really... Ow!"
13709,Shrek,SHREK,"Um, I, uh- - I guess we better move on."
13710,Shrek,FIONA,"Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried about Donkey."
13711,Shrek,SHREK,What?
13712,Shrek,FIONA,"I mean, look at him. He doesn't look so good."
13713,Shrek,DONKEY,What are you talking about? I'm fine.
13714,Shrek,FIONA,"That's what they always say, and then next thing you know, you're on your back. Dead."
13715,Shrek,SHREK,"You know, she's right. You look awful. Do you want to sit down?"
13716,Shrek,FIONA,"Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea."
13717,Shrek,DONKEY,"I didn't want to say nothin', but I got this twinge in my neck, and when I turn my head like this, look, Ow! See?"
13718,Shrek,SHREK,Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.
13719,Shrek,FIONA,I'll get the firewood.
13720,Shrek,DONKEY,"Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't feel my toes! I don't have any toes! I think I need a hug."
13721,Shrek,FIONA,Mmm. This is good. This is really good. What is this?
13722,Shrek,SHREK,"Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style."
13723,Shrek,FIONA,"No kidding. Well, this is delicious."
13724,Shrek,SHREK,"Well, they're also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean weed rat stew."
13725,Shrek,FIONA,I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night.
13726,Shrek,SHREK,"Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - you name it."
13727,Shrek,FIONA,I'd like that.
13728,Shrek,SHREK,"Um, Princess?"
13729,Shrek,FIONA,"Yes, Shrek?"
13730,Shrek,SHREK,"I, um, I was wondering...are you... Are you gonna eat that?"
13731,Shrek,DONKEY,"Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset."
13732,Shrek,FIONA,"Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it's late. I-It's very late."
13733,Shrek,SHREK,What?
13734,Shrek,DONKEY,"Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here. You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?"
13735,Shrek,FIONA,"Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside."
13736,Shrek,DONKEY,"Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until - - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark."
13737,Shrek,FIONA,Good night.
13738,Shrek,SHREK,Good night.
13739,Shrek,DONKEY,Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on here.
13740,Shrek,SHREK,"Oh, what are you talkin' about?"
13741,Shrek,DONKEY,"I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it."
13742,Shrek,SHREK,You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.
13743,Shrek,DONKEY,"Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. Just go on in and tell her how you feel."
13744,Shrek,SHREK,"I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, well, you know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't - - she's a princess, and I'm"
13745,Shrek,DONKEY,An ogre?
13746,Shrek,SHREK,Yeah. An ogre.
13747,Shrek,DONKEY,"Hey, where you goin'?"
13748,Shrek,SHREK,To get... move firewood.
13749,Shrek,DONKEY,"Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you? Princess?"
13750,Shrek,DONKEY,It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.
13751,Shrek,DONKEY,Aah!
13752,Shrek,FIONA,"Oh, no!"
13753,Shrek,DONKEY,"No, help!"
13754,Shrek,FIONA,Shh!
13755,Shrek,DONKEY,Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
13756,Shrek,FIONA,"No, it's okay. It's okay."
13757,Shrek,DONKEY,What did you do with the princess?
13758,Shrek,FIONA,"Donkey, I'm the princess."
13759,Shrek,DONKEY,Aah!
13760,Shrek,FIONA,"It's me, in this body."
13761,Shrek,DONKEY,"Oh, my God! You ate the princess. Can you hear me?"
13762,Shrek,FIONA,Donkey!
13763,Shrek,DONKEY,"Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there!"
13764,Shrek,FIONA,No!
13765,Shrek,DONKEY,Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
13766,Shrek,FIONA,Shh.
13767,Shrek,DONKEY,Shrek!
13768,Shrek,FIONA,This is me.
13769,Shrek,DONKEY,"Princess? What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different."
13770,Shrek,FIONA,"I'm ugly, okay?"
13771,Shrek,DONKEY,"Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now - -"
13772,Shrek,FIONA,No. I - - I've been this way as long as I can remember.
13773,Shrek,DONKEY,"What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before."
13774,Shrek,FIONA,"It only happens when sun goes down. ""By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form."""
13775,Shrek,DONKEY,"Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry."
13776,Shrek,FIONA,"It's a spell. When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this."
13777,Shrek,DONKEY,"All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7."
13778,Shrek,FIONA,"But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant to look."
13779,Shrek,DONKEY,"Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?"
13780,Shrek,FIONA,I have to. Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.
13781,Shrek,DONKEY,"But, you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek - - well, you got a lot in common."
13782,Shrek,FIONA,Shrek?
13783,Shrek,SHREK,"Princess, I - - Uh, how's it going, first of all? Good? Um, good for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty and - - well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might like it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd - - uh, uh... I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go."
13784,Shrek,FIONA,"I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean, really, who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? ""Princess"" and ""ugly"" don't go together. That's why I can't stay here with Shrek."
13785,Shrek,FIONA,My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.
13786,Shrek,FIONA,"Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only way to break the spell."
13787,Shrek,DONKEY,You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.
13788,Shrek,FIONA,No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.
13789,Shrek,DONKEY,What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?
13790,Shrek,FIONA,Promise you won't tell. Promise!
13791,Shrek,DONKEY,"All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. I just know before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy. Look at my eye twitchin'."
13792,Shrek,FIONA,"I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him. Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want..."
13793,Shrek,FIONA,Shrek. Are you all right?
13794,Shrek,SHREK,Perfect! Never been better.
13795,Shrek,FIONA,I - - I don't - - There's something I have to tell you.
13796,Shrek,SHREK,"You don't have to tell me anything, Princess. I heard enough last night."
13797,Shrek,FIONA,You heard what I said?
13798,Shrek,SHREK,Every word.
13799,Shrek,FIONA,I thought you'd understand.
13800,Shrek,SHREK,"Oh, I understand. Like you said, ""Who could love a hideous, ugly beast?"""
13801,Shrek,FIONA,But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.
13802,Shrek,SHREK,"Yeah? Well, it does. Ah, right on time. Princess, I've brought you a little something."
13803,Shrek,DONKEY,What'd I miss? What'd I miss? Who said that? Couldn't have been the donkey.
13804,Shrek,SHREK,As promised. Now hand it over.
13805,Shrek,FIONA,"Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying a short... farewell."
13806,Shrek,FIONA,"No, you're right. It doesn't."
13807,Shrek,FIONA,"Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make - -"
13808,Shrek,FIONA,"No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get married today before the sun sets."
13809,Shrek,FIONA,"Fare-thee-well, ogre."
13810,Shrek,DONKEY,"Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away."
13811,Shrek,SHREK,Yeah? So what?
13812,Shrek,DONKEY,"Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to her last night, She's - -"
13813,Shrek,SHREK,"I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?"
13814,Shrek,DONKEY,"Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you."
13815,Shrek,SHREK,"I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!"
13816,Shrek,DONKEY,But I thought - -
13817,Shrek,SHREK,Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong!
13818,Shrek,DONKEY,Shrek.
13819,Shrek,SHREK,Donkey? What are you doing?
13820,Shrek,DONKEY,"I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see one."
13821,Shrek,SHREK,"Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it."
13822,Shrek,DONKEY,"It is around your half. See that's your half, and this is my half."
13823,Shrek,SHREK,Oh! Your half. Hmm.
13824,Shrek,DONKEY,"Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head."
13825,Shrek,SHREK,Back off!
13826,Shrek,DONKEY,"No, you back off."
13827,Shrek,SHREK,This is my swamp!
13828,Shrek,DONKEY,Our swamp.
13829,Shrek,SHREK,"Let go, Donkey!"
13830,Shrek,DONKEY,You let go.
13831,Shrek,SHREK,Stubborn jackass!
13832,Shrek,DONKEY,Smelly ogre.
13833,Shrek,SHREK,Fine!
13834,Shrek,DONKEY,"Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet."
13835,Shrek,SHREK,"Well, I'm through with you."
13836,Shrek,DONKEY,"Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, ""Me, me, me!"" Well, guess what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! You're always pushing me around or pushing me away."
13837,Shrek,SHREK,"Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?"
13838,Shrek,DONKEY,Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!
13839,Shrek,SHREK,"Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in the back!"
13840,Shrek,DONKEY,"Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings."
13841,Shrek,SHREK,Go away!
13842,Shrek,DONKEY,"There you are , doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she ever do was like you, maybe even love you."
13843,Shrek,SHREK,"Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of you talking."
13844,Shrek,DONKEY,"She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about, uh, somebody else."
13845,Shrek,SHREK,"She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about?"
13846,Shrek,DONKEY,"Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. Right? Right?"
13847,Shrek,SHREK,Donkey!
13848,Shrek,DONKEY,No!
13849,Shrek,SHREK,"Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?"
13850,Shrek,DONKEY,"Hey, that's what friends are for, right?"
13851,Shrek,SHREK,Right. Friends?
13852,Shrek,DONKEY,Friends.
13853,Shrek,SHREK,"So, um, what did Fiona say about me?"
13854,Shrek,DONKEY,What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?
13855,Shrek,SHREK,The wedding! We'll never make it in time.
13856,Shrek,DONKEY,"Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way and I have a way."
13857,Shrek,SHREK,Donkey?
13858,Shrek,DONKEY,I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
13859,Shrek,SHREK,"Aw, come here, you."
13860,Shrek,DONKEY,"All right, all right. Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install the seat belts yet."
13861,Shrek,FIONA,Um-
13862,Shrek,FIONA,"Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the ""I do's""?"
13863,Shrek,DONKEY,"Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about that? Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't you?"
13864,Shrek,SHREK,What are you talking about?
13865,Shrek,DONKEY,"There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, ""Speak now or forever hold your peace."" That's when you say, ""I object!"""
13866,Shrek,SHREK,I don't have time for this!
13867,Shrek,DONKEY,"Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this woman, don't you?"
13868,Shrek,SHREK,Yes.
13869,Shrek,DONKEY,You wanna hold her?
13870,Shrek,SHREK,Yes.
13871,Shrek,DONKEY,Please her?
13872,Shrek,SHREK,Yes!
13873,Shrek,DONKEY,"Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. The chicks love that romantic crap!"
13874,Shrek,SHREK,All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?
13875,Shrek,DONKEY,We gotta check it out.
13876,Shrek,SHREK,What do you see?
13877,Shrek,DONKEY,The whole town's in there.
13878,Shrek,DONKEY,They're at the altar.
13879,Shrek,DONKEY,Mother Fletcher! He already said it.
13880,Shrek,SHREK,"Oh, for the love of Pete!"
13881,Shrek,SHREK,I object!
13882,Shrek,FIONA,Shrek?
13883,Shrek,SHREK,"Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first of all. Very clean."
13884,Shrek,FIONA,What are you doing here?
13885,Shrek,SHREK,"Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a wedding..."
13886,Shrek,SHREK,Fiona! I need to talk to you.
13887,Shrek,FIONA,"Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me"
13888,Shrek,SHREK,But you can't marry him.
13889,Shrek,FIONA,And why not?
13890,Shrek,SHREK,Because- - Because he's just marring you so he can be king.
13891,Shrek,SHREK,He's not your true love.
13892,Shrek,FIONA,And what do you know about true love?
13893,Shrek,SHREK,"Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - -"
13894,Shrek,FIONA,"Shrek, is this true?"
13895,Shrek,FIONA,"""By night one way, by day another."" I wanted to show you before."
13896,Shrek,SHREK,"Well, uh, that explains a lot."
13897,Shrek,SHREK,"No, no!"
13898,Shrek,FIONA,Shrek!
13899,Shrek,FIONA,"No, let go of me! Shrek!"
13900,Shrek,SHREK,No!
13901,Shrek,SHREK,Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!
13902,Shrek,FIONA,"No, Shrek!"
13903,Shrek,SHREK,Fiona!
13904,Shrek,DONKEY,"All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it. I'm a donkey on the edge!"
13905,Shrek,DONKEY,"Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?"
13906,Shrek,DONKEY,"Go ahead, Shrek."
13907,Shrek,SHREK,"Uh, Fiona?"
13908,Shrek,FIONA,"Yes, Shrek?"
13909,Shrek,SHREK,I - - I love you.
13910,Shrek,FIONA,Really?
13911,Shrek,SHREK,"Really, really."
13912,Shrek,FIONA,I love you too.
13913,Shrek,SHREK,Fiona? Fiona. Are you all right?
13914,Shrek,FIONA,"Well, yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful."
13915,Shrek,SHREK,But you ARE beautiful.
13916,Shrek,DONKEY,I was hoping this would be a happy ending.
13917,Shrek,DONKEY,"Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't breathe. I can't breathe."

14328,South-Park,STAN,"Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other."
14329,South-Park,CARTMAN,Yeah! You're all a bunch of stupid sons a bitches!
14330,South-Park,STAN,"Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little."
14331,South-Park,KYLE,"Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-"
14332,South-Park,STAN,Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
14333,South-Park,STAN,My friend the clitoris told me.
14334,South-Park,STAN,Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
14335,South-Park,STAN,But Wendy... What about Gregory?
14336,South-Park,STAN,You didn't?
14337,South-Park,STAN,Cool!
14338,South-Park,STAN,Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for
14339,South-Park,KYLE,"Oh he can, dude. Look!"
14340,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Cordé...
14341,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Less than an hour ago, an assassination attempt was made against my life. One of my bodyguards and six others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered. I was the target but, more importantly, I believe this security measure before you, was the target. I have led the opposition to build an army... but there is someone in this body who will stop at nothing to assure it's passage..."
14342,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"I warn you, if you vote to create this army, war will follow. I have experienced the misery of war first-hand; I do not wish to do it again."
14343,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Wake up, Senators... you must wake up! If you offer the separatists violence, they can only show us violence in return! Many will lose their lives. All will lose their freedom. This decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great Republic. I pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision. Vote down this security measure, which is nothing less than a declaration of war! Does anyone here want that? I cannot believe they do."
14344,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you have any idea who was behind the attack?"
14345,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I don't wish to disagree but I think that Count Dooku was behind it.
14346,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"I don't know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it..."
14347,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe the..."
14348,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Chancellor, please! I don't want any more guards!"
14349,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"This is not necessary, Chancellor."
14350,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar."
14351,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Hi, Jar Jar."
14352,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"It's a great pleasure to see you again, M'Lady."
14353,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,It has been far too long Master Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths have crossed again... but I must warn you that I think your presence here is unnecessary.
14354,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,I'm sure the Jedi Council have their reasons.
14355,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Annie?? My goodness you've grown.
14356,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"So have you... grown more beautiful, I mean... and much shorter... for a Senator, I mean."
14357,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Oh Annie, you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine."
14358,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Our presence will be invisible, M'Lady."
14359,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"I don't need more security, I need answers. I want to know who is trying to kill me."
14360,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"We're here to protect you Senator, not to start an investigation."
14361,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"We will find out who is trying to kill you Padmé, I promise you."
14362,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"We are not going to exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner."
14363,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"I meant in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course."
14364,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"We are not going through this exercise again, Anakin. You will pay attention to my lead."
14365,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Why?
14366,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,What??!!
14367,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security... not Jedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate."
14368,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"We will do as the Council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one."
14369,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed. Now if you will excuse me I will retire."
14370,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"She didn't even recognise me, Jar Jar. I thought about her every day since we parted... and she's forgotten me completely."
14371,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Anakin, you're focusing on the Negative again. Be mindful of your thoughts. She was glad to see us. Now lets check the security here."
14372,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Yes, my master."
14373,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin will try that way. Any activity up here?
14374,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Quiet as a tomb. I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her.
14375,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,What's going on?
14376,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,She covered that camera. I don't think she liked me watching her.
14377,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,What is she thinking?
14378,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,She programmed Artoo to warn us if there's an intruder.
14379,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,It's not an intruder I'm worried about. There are many other ways to kill a Senator.
14380,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. Don't we, Master?"
14381,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,You're using her as bait??
14382,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,It was her idea... No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.
14383,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"It's too risky... and your senses aren't that attuned, young apprentice."
14384,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,And yours are?
14385,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Possibly.
14386,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,You look tired.
14387,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"I don't sleep well, anymore."
14388,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Because of your mother?
14389,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I don't know why I keep dreaming About her now. I haven't seen her since I was little.
14390,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Dreams pass in time.
14391,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I'd rather dream of Padmé. Just Being around her again is... intoxicating.
14392,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you. You've made a commitment to the Jedi order... a commitment not easily broken... and don't forget she's a politician. They're not to be trusted."
14393,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"She's not like the others in the Senate, Master."
14394,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,It's been my experience that Senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds.
14395,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Not another lecture, Master. Not on the economics of politics.... It's too early in the morning... and besides, you're generalising. The Chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt."
14396,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Palpatine's a politician, I've observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the Senators."
14397,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I think he is a good man. My instincts are very positive about...
14398,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"I sense it, too."
14399,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Stay here!
14400,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,I have a bad feeling about this.
14401,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,That was wacky! I almost lost you in the traffic.
14402,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,What took you so long?
14403,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't find a speeder I really liked, with an open cockpit... and with the right speed capabilities... and then you know I had to get a really gonzo color..."
14404,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"If you'd spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit, young Padawan, you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman."
14405,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I thought I already did.
14406,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Only in your mind, my very young apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!"
14407,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Sorry, I forgot you don't like flying, Master."
14408,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,I don't mind flying... but what you're doing is suicide!
14409,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Master, you know I've been flying since before I could walk. I'm very good at this."
14410,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Just slow down!
14411,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Wait! Don't go in there!
14412,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,You know I don't like it when you do that!
14413,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this guy's gonna kill himself any minute now!"
14414,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,What are you doing? He's gonna blast me!
14415,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Right - this isn't working.
14416,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,That was too close!
14417,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Clear that!
14418,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,What??
14419,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Clear the flag! We're losing power! Hurry!
14420,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I don't like it when you do that!
14421,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"So sorry, Master."
14422,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,It's dangerous near those power couplings! Slow down! Don't go through there!
14423,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Yiiii, what are you doing?"
14424,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Sorry, Master!"
14425,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Oh, that was good..."
14426,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,That was crazy!!!
14427,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Ahh, damn."
14428,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Stop!!
14429,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"No, we can make it."
14430,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm crazy.
14431,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,But it worked... we made it.
14432,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,It didn't work... we've stalled! And you almost got us killed!
14433,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I think we're still alive.
14434,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,It was stupid!
14435,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I could have made it...
14436,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,But you didn't!!! And now we've lost him.
14437,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,No we didnt...
14438,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Where are you going?! He went down there, the other way."
14439,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,This is a shortcut... I think.
14440,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"What do you mean, You think? What kind of shortcut?! He went completely the other way! Youve lost him!"
14441,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Master, if we keep this chase going, that creeps gonna end up deep fried. Personally, Id very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who hes working for..."
14442,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Oh, so thats why were going in the wrong direction."
14443,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Well, you lost him."
14444,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Im deeply sorry, Master."
14445,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Excuse me for a moment.
14446,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Anakin!
14447,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"She went into that club, Master."
14448,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Patience.
14449,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Here. Next time try not to lose it.
14450,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Sorry, Master."
14451,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,A Jedi's saber is his most precious possession.
14452,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Yes, Master."
14453,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,He must keep it with him at all times.
14454,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"I know, Master."
14455,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,This weapon is your life!
14456,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I've heard this lesson before...
14457,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"But, you haven't learned anything, Anakin."
14458,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"I try, Master."
14459,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Why do I think you are going to be the death of me?!
14460,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Don't say that Master... You're the closest thing I have to a father... I love you. I don't want to cause you pain.
14461,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Then why don't you listen to me?!
14462,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"I will. I'll do better, I promise."
14463,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Do you see him him?
14464,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I think he's a she...
14465,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Then be extra careful... Check it out.
14466,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Where are you going, Master?"
14467,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,To get a drink.
14468,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,You don't want to sell me death- sticks.
14469,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,You want to go home and rethink your life.
14470,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Easy... Official business. Go back to your drinks.
14471,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Do you know who it was you were trying to kill?
14472,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Who hired you?
14473,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Tell us!
14474,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,This wound's going to need treatment.
14475,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Who hired you? Tell us... tell us now!
14476,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Toxic Dart...
14477,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Representative Binks. I know I can count on you.
14478,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,What?!
14479,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"You're a good friend, Jar Jar. I don't wish to hold you up. I'm sure you have a great deal to do."
14480,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I do not like this idea of hiding.
14481,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Don't worry. Now that the Council has ordered an investigation, it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find that bounty hunter."
14482,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"I haven't worked for a year to defeat the ""Military Creation Act"" not to be here when its fate is decided."
14483,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.
14484,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and you don't have a very firm grip on politics. I suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time."
14485,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying to..."
14486,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Annie! No!
14487,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Please don't call me that.
14488,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,What?
14489,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Annie...
14490,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"I've always called you that... it is your name, isn't it?"
14491,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,It's Anakin. When you say Annie it's like I'm still a little boy... and I'm not.
14492,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible to deny you've... ...that you've grown up."
14493,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it...
14494,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow.
14495,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only... although I'm a Padawan learner, in some ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead of him. I'm ready for the trials. I know I am! He knows it too. He believes I'm too unpredictable... Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it... I know I started my training late... but he won't let me move on."
14496,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,That must be frustrating.
14497,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,It's worse... he's overly critical. He never listens! He just doesn't understand! It's not fair!
14498,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"I'm sorry... You sounded exactly like that little boy I once knew, when he didn't get his way."
14499,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I'm not whining! I'm not.
14500,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I didn't say it to hurt you.
14501,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I know...
14502,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Anakin...
14503,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Don't try to grow up too fast.
14504,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I am grown up. You said it yourself.
14505,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Please don't look at me like that.
14506,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Why not?
14507,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Because I can see what you're thinking.
14508,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers too?"
14509,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,It makes me feel uncomfortable.
14510,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Sorry, M'lady."
14511,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dorme... the threat's on you two now."
14512,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,You'll be fine.
14513,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Then my Jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is.
14514,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Anakin, you stay put on Naboo. Do not attract any attention. Do absolutely nothing without checking in with me or the Council."
14515,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Yes, Master."
14516,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"I will get to the bottom of this plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be back here in no time."
14517,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"I will be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi."
14518,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Time to go.
14519,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I know.
14520,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,May the Force be with you.
14521,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"May the Force be with you, Master."
14522,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Suddenly, I'm afraid..."
14523,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I'm kinda scared too. This is my first assignment on my own.
14524,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,There's nothing to worry about... we have Artoo with us.
14525,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,I hope he doesn't try anything foolish.
14526,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,It's a toxic dart. I need to know where it came from and who made it.
14527,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Excuse me? Could you try again please?
14528,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Thanks for your assistance! You may not be able to figure this out, but I think I know someone who might."
14529,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"No, no, Mom, no..."
14530,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,What?
14531,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,You seemed to be having a nightmare.
14532,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Are you hungry?
14533,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Thank you.
14534,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,We went into lightspeed a while ago.
14535,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I've thought about it every day since I left. It's by far the most beautiful place I've ever seen...
14536,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception.
14537,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception.
14538,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like...
14539,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Or be with the people I love.
14540,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.
14541,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love."
14542,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,You have changed so much
14543,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either.
14544,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,It hasn't...
14545,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"I can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualise the Force, those hills are what I see."
14546,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I love Naboo.
14547,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Were you dreaming about you mother earlier, weren't you?"
14548,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Yes... I left Tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading. I don't want to lose it. Recently I've been seeing her in my dreams... vivid dreams... scary dreams. I worry about her."
14549,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,I'm looking for Dexter.
14550,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,He's not in trouble. It's personal.
14551,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Hey, Dex."
14552,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Thank you.
14553,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Hey, Dex."
14554,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,You can tell me what this is.
14555,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Do you know where it came from?
14556,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Kamino Kyberdart... I wonder why it didn't show up in any analysis archive.
14557,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Well, Dex, if droids could think, we wouldn't be here, would we? Kamino... doesn't sound familiar. Is it part of the Republic?"
14558,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Cloners? Are they friendly?
14559,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"On what, Dex?"
14560,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"If I grew up here, I don't think I'd ever leave."
14561,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I doubt that.
14562,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about... The problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers..."
14563,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"...and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw the Capital, I was very young... I'd never seen a waterfall before. I though they were so beautiful... I never dreamed one day I'd live in the palace."
14564,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?"
14565,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"No! That was the last thing I thought of. My dream was to help in the ""Refugee Relief Movement."" I never thought of running for elected office. But the more history I studied, the more I realised how much good politicians could do. So when I was eight, I joined the ""Apprentice Legislators"", then later on became a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that, before I knew it, I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. I wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready."
14566,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.
14567,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Popular rule is not democracy, Annie. It gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up. So were my parents. They worried About me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was hoping to have a family by now... My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids... but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn't refuse her."
14568,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I agree! I think the Republic needs you... I'm glad you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.
14569,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I think so too.
14570,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Thank you, Your Highness. I only Wish I could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote."
14571,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"About two hundred. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war."
14572,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I'm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help."
14573,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"I'm afraid that, despite the Chancellor's best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds."
14574,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"There are rumours, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered."
14575,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It would be to be too dangerous for the economy, we were told."
14576,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Let's pray that day never comes.
14577,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor. He's still a Padawan learner. I was thinking..."
14578,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Hey, hold on a minute!"
14579,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated.
14580,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here, M'Lady."
14581,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home. I know it very well... that is why we're here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance."
14582,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Sorry, M'Lady."
14583,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Yes... yes, I did..."
14584,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,I never understood why he quit. Only twenty Jedi have ever left the Order.
14585,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,What happened?
14586,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Really?
14587,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Interesting... I'm still not sure I understand.
14588,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Yes, I'm trying to find a planet system called Kamino. It doesn't seem to show upon any of the archive charts."
14589,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"According to my information, it should be in this quadrant somewhere... just south of the Rishi Maze."
14590,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,All three actually.
14591,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Absolutely.
14592,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Wouldn't that be on record?
14593,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,That's impossible... perhaps the archives are incomplete.
14594,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,There's my house!
14595,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,What? Don't say you're shy!
14596,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"No, but I..."
14597,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Ryoo!! Pooja!!
14598,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"I'm so happy to see you! This is Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and this is Pooja."
14599,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Anakin, this is my sister, Sola."
14600,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Hello.
14601,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,A little.
14602,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"He's being polite, Mom. We're starving."
14603,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend! He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me.
14604,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"It's not, Mom, I promise. Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis?"
14605,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,He grew up.
14606,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Mom, I'm not in any danger."
14607,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,...Yes... I'm afraid she is.
14608,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,But not much.
14609,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Padme tells me you teach at the university?
14610,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,What's there to talk about? He's just a boy.
14611,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Sola - stop it!
14612,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"I'm not your baby sister, Sola. Anakin and I are friends... our relationship is strictly professional. Mom, would you tell her to stop it?"
14613,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Cut it out.
14614,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What I'm doing is important."
14615,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"There have been two attempts on her life. Chances are there'll be more. My Master is tracking down the assassins. I'm sure he'll find out who they are. This situation, won't last long."
14616,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I don't either.
14617,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Don't worry, this won't take long."
14618,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I just want to get there before dark.
14619,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,You still live at home.
14620,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"I move around so much, I've never had a place of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home."
14621,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I never had a real home. Home was always where my Mom was.
14622,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Is this you?
14623,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"That was when I went with the Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran. Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying. I was helping to relocate the children. See that little one I'm holding? His name was N'a-kee-tula, which means sweethear. He was so full of life,. All those kids were. I did everything I could to save him, but he died... they all did. They were never able to adapt... to live off their native planet."
14624,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,My first day as an Apprentice Legislator. Notice the difference?
14625,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"I am sorry to disturb you, Master."
14626,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Im looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the system doesnt show up on the archive maps.
14627,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,This is where it ought to be... but it isnt. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here... but there isnt.
14628,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"But Master Yoda who could have erased information from the archives? Thats impossible, isnt it?"
14629,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water."
14630,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet.
14631,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,...We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.
14632,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"I dont like sand. Its coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everythings soft... and smooth..."
14633,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical.
14634,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Everything here is magical.
14635,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real... but it wasnt.
14636,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real. Real enough, anyway..."
14637,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"I used to think if you looked too deeply into glass, you would lose yourself."
14638,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I think it's true...
14639,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I shouldn't have done that.
14640,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"I'm sorry. When I'm around you, my mind is no longer my own."
14641,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,It's the situation... the stress...
14642,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,...the view.
14643,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be on his own.
14644,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,But he still has much to learn. And his abilities have made him... well... arrogant. I realise now what you and Master Yoda knew from the beginning... the boy was too old to start the training and...
14645,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Master, he should not have been given this assignment. I'm afraid Anakin won't be able to protect the Senator."
14646,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,He has a... an emotional connection with her. It's been there since he was boy. Now he's confused... distracted.
14647,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Has Master Yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will come about?
14648,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,You did that?
14649,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,What?
14650,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,That! Now stop it!
14651,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Anakin!!
14652,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"I'm not really supposed to do that... for fun, I mean. If Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be very grumpy."
14653,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,May I tell you something?
14654,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I don't know.
14655,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Then how can I tell you?
14656,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition.
14657,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,It doesn't work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you.
14658,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Anakin, don't..."
14659,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm close to you again, I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask..."
14660,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me."
14661,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,...I can't. We can't. It's just not possible.
14662,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Anything's possible. Padme, please listen..."
14663,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi Knight. I'm a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other."
14664,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Then you do feel something! There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that.
14665,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Annie, it doesn't make any difference. Jedi aren't allowed to marry. You swore an oath, remember? You'd be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future, for me."
14666,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away... but I can't.
14667,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I am not going to give into this. I'm not going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than fall in love.
14668,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,It wouldn't have to be that way... we could keep it a secret.
14669,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. Mt sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?"
14670,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"...No, you're right. It would destroy us."
14671,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,I'm expected?
14672,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Obi-Wan Kenobi.
14673,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,You make me feel most welcome.
14674,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,That is... good news.
14675,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,I'm sorry Master - ?
14676,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas."
14677,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,That's why I'm here.
14678,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I don't know...
14679,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Sure you do... you just don't want to tell me.
14680,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?
14681,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak-minded.
14682,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,All right... his name was Palo. I was twelve. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older then I... very cute... dark curly hair... dreamy eyes.
14683,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"All right, I get the picture... whatever happened to him?"
14684,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I went on to become a Queen. He went on to become an artist.
14685,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Maybe he was the smart one.
14686,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"You really don't like politicians, do you?"
14687,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"I like two or three, but I'm not really sure about one of them. I don't think the system works."
14688,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,How would you have it work?
14689,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it."
14690,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't wlways agree. In fact, they hardly ever do."
14691,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Then they should be made to.
14692,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,By whom? Who's going to make them?
14693,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I don't know. Someone.
14694,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,You?
14695,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Of course not me.
14696,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,But someone.
14697,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Someone wise.
14698,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.
14699,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Well, if it works..."
14700,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,You're making fun of me.
14701,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"On no, I'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator."
14702,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,You're so bad!
14703,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,You're always so serious. Always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders.
14704,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Who was the original host?
14705,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Where is this bounty hunter now?
14706,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Unaltered?
14707,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,I would like to meet this Jango Fett.
14708,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,You mentioned growth acceleration...
14709,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,And these?
14710,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Very impressive.
14711,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Tell me, prime minister, when my Master Sido-dyas first contacted you, did he say the order was for... himself... or?"
14712,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,The Repubic?
14713,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Arfour, Arfour..."
14714,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Arfour, relay this, ""scramble code five,"" to Courscant: care of ""the old folks home."""
14715,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"...I've never heard of a Jedi called Sido-Dyas, have you, Master?"
14716,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we're looking for.
14717,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"I will, Master, and I will also find out more about this clone army... May The Force..."
14718,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"No...No...No...Mom!...Don't, no, don't!"
14719,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Don't go.
14720,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I don't want to disturb you.
14721,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Your presence is soothing.
14722,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,You had a nightmare again last night.
14723,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Jedi don't have nightmares.
14724,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I heard you.
14725,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She's suffering, Padme. She is in pain...They're killing her! I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I must go. I have to help her! I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a choice."
14726,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Annie, I told you I wouldn't let you give up your future for me. I'll go with you. That way you can continue to protect me, and you won't be disobeying your mandate."
14727,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,What about Master Obi-wan?
14728,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"I guess we won't tell him, will we?"
14729,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud.
14730,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Aren't we all?
14731,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant?
14732,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Recently?
14733,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Then you must know Master Sido- Dyas?
14734,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Sido-Dyas. Isnt he the Jedi who hired you for this job?
14735,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,No? I thought...
14736,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Curious...
14737,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,It seems to me it's your army - being that they are all clones of you.
14738,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"I look forward to seeing them in action. Thank you for your time, Jango."
14739,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Wait, please."
14740,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Excuse me, Watto."
14741,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I said excuse me.
14742,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Let me help you with that.
14743,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.
14744,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,My mother...
14745,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Sold her...
14746,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Do you know where they are?
14747,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I'd like to know.
14748,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,I won't forget.
14749,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Stay with the ship, Artoo."
14750,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,Good evening. May I help you?
14751,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Threepio?
14752,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,"Oh, my... oh, my! Master Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly believe it! And this must be Miss Padme."
14753,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Hello, Threepio."
14754,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I've come to see my mother.
14755,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,"Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry, Master Annie."
14756,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Threepio, what's happened?"
14757,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,I think we'd better go inside.
14758,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,Master Lars - Master Owen! Somebody to see you!
14759,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here looking for my mother.
14760,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I'm Padme.
14761,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Is my mother here?
14762,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,To find my mother.
14763,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"No, Annie!"
14764,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"I can feel her pain, and I will find her. I know she's alive."
14765,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"You are going to have to stay here. These are good people, Padme. You'll be safe."
14766,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Anakin...
14767,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"I trust you'll watch over her, Owen."
14768,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I won't be long.
14769,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,"Please don't leave us, Miss Padme. These people need your help."
14770,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just can't sleep."
14771,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,"That's something I cannot relate to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm either active or inactive. There's no in-between."
14772,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I guess you're lucky.
14773,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,Do you really think so..? I suppose I shouldn't expect...
14774,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,You're not happy here?
14775,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,"Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my masters here ar so kind I wouldn't wish to trouuble them, it's just... being like this... well, it's embarrassing."
14776,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Being like what?
14777,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,"Naked. If you pardon the expression. You see, when Master Annie made me, he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering. It's so humiliating. How would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing?"
14778,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I guess I wouldn't like it at all.
14779,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,Of course you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's simply not protocol.
14780,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Maybe we can do something about it.
14781,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,I don't think so. Only Master Annie...
14782,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Why not? They seem to have a box of old coverings here.
14783,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,"Oh? How observant of you, Miss Padme. Of course, I'm just not mechanically minded... if you see what I mean."
14784,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Let's see, if we put this... here..."
14785,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,Ooooh! That's tickles.
14786,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"You'll have to be quiet, Threepio. Hold still, please."
14787,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Mom... Mom... Mom...
14788,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Im here, Mom. Youre safe. Hang on. Im going to get you out of here..."
14789,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Just stay with me, Mom. Im going to make you well again. Everythings going to be fine."
14790,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"""Guiding light"" to ""old folks home."""
14791,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,...Starships from the Trade Federation and the Commerce Guilds are taking deliveries of battle droids from the foundries on Geonosis.
14792,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,The droid foundry seems to be working at full capacity. I am going to go down and investigate. I will bring Jango Fett back home for interrogation.
14793,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,One more thing. Jango mentioned he was recruited by someone named Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that might be?
14794,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Do you believe he could be the mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the deal for the clone army?"
14795,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Let me see if I can figure out what's going on first.
14796,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,There!
14797,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,Um. How do I look?
14798,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,"Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm so happy! Oh, pardon me."
14799,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,Thank you.
14800,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
14801,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,"Oh, my!"
14802,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,...Alliance have pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming an... Wait!... ah... attack... I don't... make it... aaaggghhh!
14803,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I'm going after him!
14804,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to Coruscant.
14805,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Yeah, you're right, you're right."
14806,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Understood, Master."
14807,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come half way across the galaxy. Look, Geonosis is less than a parsec away."
14808,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,If he's still alive.
14809,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Annie, are you just going to sit here and let him die?? He's your friend... your mentor..."
14810,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"...He's like my father, but you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here."
14811,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,He gave you strict orders to protect me...
14812,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan. So if you plan to protect me, you will have to come along."
14813,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"Hey, where are you going?"
14814,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,To find Obi-Wan.
14815,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,No! You're not!
14816,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Let go of me!
14817,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I'm not letting you go out there. It's too dangerous.
14818,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,What?!?
14819,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"It's my job to protect you. I said it's too dangerous. You're not going, and that's final!"
14820,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Don't you give me orders, Annie! I'm a Senator of the Galactic Republic. You have no authority to contain me, restrain me, or direct me! You remember your place, young man. Now you can come along and protect me or stay here. It's up to you."
14821,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,"Yes, it is, Artoo. Most confusing. One moment they're generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next, waves of violent hostility. Even though I'm programmed to understand them, I doubt if I ever shall."
14822,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,It's empty!
14823,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Wait!
14824,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Count Dooku, I assume."
14825,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Don't worry he's housebroken.
14826,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi- Wan Kenobi. I am formally requesting you turn him over to me, now."
14827,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,He is an officer of the Republic. You can't do that.
14828,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"And if I don't join your rebellion, I assume this Jedi with me will also die?"
14829,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"The ideals are still alive, Count, even if the institution is failing."
14830,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"If what you say is true, you should stay in the Republic and help Chancellor Palpatine put things right."
14831,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"I cannot believe that. I will not forsake all I have honoured and worked for and betray the Republic. I know of your treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others, Count. What is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business... it's business becoming government!"
14832,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,What is to happen to me? Am I to be executed also?
14833,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Anakin...
14834,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"You are committing an act of war, Archduke. I hope you are prepared for the consequences."
14835,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Don't be afraid.
14836,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.
14837,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,What are you talking about?
14838,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,I love you.
14839,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,You love me?! I thought we decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie. That it would destroy our lives...
14840,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. My love for you is a puzzle, Annie, for which I have no answers. I can't control it... and now I don't care. I truly, deeply love you, and before we die I want you to know."
14841,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"I have no desire to be cured of this love either. Long or short, I vow to spend the rest of my life with you."
14842,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,I was beginning to wonder if you had gotten my message.
14843,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"I retransmitted it as you requested, Master. Then we decided to come and rescue you."
14844,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,It looks like you're going a good job so far.
14845,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I have a bad feeling about this.
14846,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Take the one the left. I'll take the one on the right.
14847,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,What about Padme?
14848,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,It looks like she's already on top of things.
14849,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,You okay?
14850,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,"Sure! Well, sort of."
14851,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Jump!!!
14852,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,"Yes, it has been rather a long time. Do you suppose something's happened to them?"
14853,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,"Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't think so. It looks a very dull planet to me. They should be back shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo."
14854,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,I don't hear anything. You're scaring me! Stop imagining things!
14855,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Someone's got to - shut down - these droids.
14856,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Look!
14857,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,C-3PO,"I'm sure I heard something, this time. Didn't you? It's probably just a celebration"
14858,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Hold on! Look over there...
14859,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"It's Dooku, go after him!"
14860,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Padme!!!
14861,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Put the ship down! Down!
14862,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,No! Forget her. We have to go after Dooku.
14863,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,No we're not!! Land this ship!
14864,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Don't let your personal feelings get in the way. We've got a job to do.
14865,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I don't care!.. Go back.
14866,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Anakin! She's all right! Look.
14867,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Follow that speeder!
14868,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,We move in together - you slowly on the...
14869,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I'm taking him now!
14870,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"Anakin, no!"
14871,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,"You'll pay for all the Jedi you've killed today, Dooku."
14872,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,I don't think so.
14873,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,You will have to prove it.
14874,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,I'm a slow learner.
14875,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,ANAKIN,Don't bet on it!
14876,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,Anakin!
14877,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,PADME,Anakin!
14878,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,On his way back to Naboo. He is escorting Senator Amidala home.
14879,Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones,OBI-WAN,"I must admit without the clones, it would not have been a victory."
14880,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place."
14881,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit."
14882,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose."
14883,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,Goodness gracious me!
14884,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.
14885,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go."
14886,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this."
14887,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me!"
14888,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no."
14889,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt."
14890,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.
14891,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.
14892,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this."
14893,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,Good morning.
14894,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"The message, Artoo, the message."
14895,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids."
14896,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,What did he say?
14897,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message."
14898,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,We're doomed.
14899,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite."
14900,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!
14901,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"I am See-Threepio, human-cy..."
14902,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh. Well, yes."
14903,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily..."
14904,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,Disintegrated?
14905,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh, no! Chewbacca!"
14906,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!"
14907,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand.
14908,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand."
14909,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,Because he's holding a thermal detonator.
14910,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.
14911,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,He agrees!
14912,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,I can't see.
14913,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Where am I?
14914,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Who are you?
14915,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,Someone who loves you.
14916,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Leia!
14917,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,I gotta get you out of here.
14918,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,What's that? I know that laugh.
14919,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault."
14920,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Look...
14921,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!
14922,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...
14923,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,Ugh!
14924,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Ohhh, I can't bear to watch."
14925,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Chewie? Chewie, is that you?"
14926,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Ah! Chew--Chewie!
14927,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?"
14928,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody."
14929,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur."
14930,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"I'm all right, pal. I'm all right."
14931,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,I must speak with Jabba.
14932,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,You will take me to Jabba now!
14933,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,You serve your master well.
14934,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,And you will be rewarded.
14935,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.
14936,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,I must be allowed to speak.
14937,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.
14938,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers."
14939,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Master Luke, you're standing on..."
14940,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh, no! The Rancor!"
14941,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Han!
14942,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Luke!
14943,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Are you all right?
14944,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Fine. Together again, huh?"
14945,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Wouldn't miss it.
14946,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,How are we doing?
14947,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,The same as always.
14948,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"That bad, huh? Where's Leia?"
14949,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,I'm here.
14950,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately."
14951,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Good, I hate long waits."
14952,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc."
14953,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years."
14954,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?"
14955,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make."
14956,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur."
14957,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know."
14958,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient."
14959,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
14960,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Oh... great!
14961,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?"
14962,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!"
14963,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,Hmm. I wish I had your confidence.
14964,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas."
14965,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right?"
14966,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.
14967,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Easy, Chewie."
14968,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Chewie, you okay? Where is he?"
14969,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"I'm okay, pal."
14970,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Lando!
14971,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
14972,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Lando, grab it!"
14973,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,I'm trying!
14974,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping."
14975,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!
14976,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!
14977,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie."
14978,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando."
14979,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
14980,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!"
14981,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.
14982,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!"
14983,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Point it at the deck!
14984,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump."
14985,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Come on!
14986,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Let's go! And don't forget the droids.
14987,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
14988,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,That's all any of us can see.
14989,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!"
14990,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
14991,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
14992,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando."
14993,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"He means ""You're welcome."""
14994,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,I'll meet you back at the fleet.
14995,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,I will.
14996,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend."
14997,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,No... of course not.
14998,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Master Yoda, you can't die."
14999,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
15000,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Then I am a Jedi?
15001,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?
15002,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Yoda, I must know."
15003,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Yes.
15004,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Unfortunate that I know the truth?
15005,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Well, I'm sorry."
15006,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone."
15007,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?
15008,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
15009,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,There's still good in him.
15010,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"I can't do it, Ben."
15011,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
15012,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,But I had to help my friends.
15013,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,I can't kill my own father.
15014,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Yoda spoke of another.
15015,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,But I have no sister.
15016,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Leia! Leia's my sister.
15017,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her."
15018,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Well, look at you, a general, huh?"
15019,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Well, who says they didn't. But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?"
15020,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Good luck.
15021,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,You're gonna need it.
15022,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,Sounds dangerous.
15023,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle."
15024,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you."
15025,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"Uh, General... count me in."
15026,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,What is it?
15027,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Luke.
15028,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Hi, Han... Chewie."
15029,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"""Exciting"" is hardly the word I would use."
15030,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
15031,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"You, too."
15032,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,You got her warmed?
15033,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Yeah, she's comin' up."
15034,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie."
15035,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"Hey, are you awake?"
15036,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again."
15037,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?"
15038,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,All set.
15039,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,Here we go again.
15040,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"All right, hang on."
15041,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie."
15042,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.
15043,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Transmission commencing.
15044,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
15045,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,It'll work. It'll work.
15046,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Vader's on that ship.
15047,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance."
15048,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,I don't know. Fly casual.
15049,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
15050,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here."
15051,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"They're not goin' for it, Chewie."
15052,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.
15053,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh, I told you it was dangerous here."
15054,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,Shall we try and go around?
15055,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
15056,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
15057,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Quietly, there might be more of them out there."
15058,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,Over there! Two more of them!
15059,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"I see them. Wait, Leia!"
15060,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Hey, wait! Ahhh!"
15061,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Move closer!
15062,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Get alongside that one!
15063,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Get him!
15064,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!"
15065,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Luke! Where's Leia?
15066,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,I thought she was with you.
15067,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,We got separated.
15068,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Hey, we better go look for her."
15069,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
15070,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners."
15071,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do."
15072,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,Cut it out!
15073,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,I'm not gonna hurt you.
15074,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here is."
15075,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down."
15076,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.
15077,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,All right. You want something to eat?
15078,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,That's right. Come on. Hmmm?
15079,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you?"
15080,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,What is it?
15081,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"Come on, let's get outta here."
15082,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Luke! Luke!
15083,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh, Master Luke."
15084,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.
15085,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.
15086,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"What, Chewie? What? Chewie!"
15087,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Hey, I don't get it."
15088,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Chewie, wa-wait! Don't!"
15089,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach."
15090,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber?"
15091,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Yeah, sure."
15092,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o- op!!"
15093,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Wha--? Hey! Point that thing someplace else.
15094,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Hey!
15095,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Han, don't. It'll be all right."
15096,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Chewie, give 'em your crossbow."
15097,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!"
15098,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Do you understand anything they're saying?
15099,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication."
15100,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,What are you telling them?
15101,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god."
15102,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?"
15103,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper."
15104,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Proper?!
15105,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
15106,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Why, you--"
15107,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.
15108,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,I have a really bad feeling about this.
15109,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,What did he say?
15110,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor."
15111,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,Oh!
15112,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,Your Royal Highness.
15113,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free."
15114,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much."
15115,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic."
15116,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly --"
15117,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Just tell them.
15118,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just..."
15119,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh!"
15120,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!"
15121,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness."
15122,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Thanks, Threepio."
15123,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that."
15124,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,What's going on?
15125,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,I don't know.
15126,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.
15127,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Just what I always wanted.
15128,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.
15129,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back."
15130,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"Luke, what's wrong?"
15131,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
15132,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
15133,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,What do you remember?
15134,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"Just...images, really. Feelings."
15135,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Tell me.
15136,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this?"
15137,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
15138,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?"
15139,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Vader is here...now, on this moon."
15140,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him."
15141,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,Why?
15142,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,He's my father.
15143,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,Your father?
15144,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance."
15145,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have."
15146,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it."
15147,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Yes. It's you Leia.
15148,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,I know. Somehow...I've always known.
15149,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Then you know why I have to face him.
15150,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you."
15151,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"No, you don't. You've always been strong."
15152,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"But, why must you confront him?"
15153,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
15154,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Hey, what's goin' on?"
15155,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.
15156,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,I...I can't tell you.
15157,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,I...
15158,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Ahhh...
15159,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,I'm sorry.
15160,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,Hold me.
15161,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"I know, father."
15162,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.
15163,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Come with me.
15164,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
15165,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate."
15166,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Then my father is truly dead.
15167,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
15168,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this."
15169,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,What's he saying?
15170,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
15171,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Back door, huh? Good idea."
15172,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm."
15173,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!"
15174,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,Quiet.
15175,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
15176,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"Oh, no."
15177,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this.
15178,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,I have decided that we shall stay here.
15179,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.
15180,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.
15181,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Your overconfidence is your weakness.
15182,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie."
15183,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
15184,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Charges! Come on, come on!"
15185,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me."
15186,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,No!
15187,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?"
15188,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?"
15189,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,We surrender.
15190,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo."
15191,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,The code's changed. We need Artoo!
15192,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Here's the terminal.
15193,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!"
15194,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,We're coming!
15195,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Come on! Come on!
15196,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh, Artoo, hurry!"
15197,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?"
15198,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing."
15199,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,I'll cover you.
15200,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,I think I got it. I got it!
15201,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?"
15202,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Let's see.
15203,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,It's not bad.
15204,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,"Oh, dear."
15205,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,I love you.
15206,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,I know.
15207,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"Chewie! Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait.... I got an idea."
15208,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"I will not fight you, father."
15209,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict."
15210,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now."
15211,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Throw me another charge.
15212,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,I will not fight you.
15213,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Never-r-r!
15214,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,"Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me."
15215,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,Move! Move!
15216,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you.
15217,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,ANAKIN,"You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right."
15218,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LUKE,Father...I won't leave you.
15219,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,C-3PO,They did it!
15220,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
15221,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,He wasn't. I can feel it.
15222,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"You love him, don't you?"
15223,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,Yes.
15224,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,HAN,"All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way."
15225,Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi,LEIA,"Oh. No, it's not like that at all. He's my brother."
15226,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me?"
15227,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Loud and clear, kid. What's up?"
15228,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings."
15229,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed, I'm going back."
15230,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long.
15231,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?"
15232,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Aaargh!
15233,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Chewie!
15234,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand."
15235,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place. You'll know if anything comes around."
15236,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.
15237,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore."
15238,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man."
15239,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Thank you, General."
15240,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it."
15241,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,That's right.
15242,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess."
15243,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Han!
15244,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Yes, Your Highnessness?"
15245,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,I thought you decided to stay.
15246,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind."
15247,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"Han, we need you!"
15248,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,We?
15249,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Yes.
15250,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Oh, what about you need?"
15251,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,I need? I don't know what you're talking about.
15252,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,You probably don't.
15253,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,And what precisely am I supposed to know?
15254,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
15255,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...
15256,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh - uh huh! Come on.
15257,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,You're imagining things.
15258,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?
15259,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
15260,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!
15261,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess' chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know.
15262,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Oh, switch off."
15263,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these.
15264,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Excuse me, sir."
15265,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Put them back together right now.
15266,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Might I have a word with you, please?"
15267,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,What do you want?
15268,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator."
15269,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.
15270,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is."
15271,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,I don't know where he is.
15272,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,Nobody knows where he is.
15273,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"What do you mean, ""nobody knows""?"
15274,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Well, uh, you see..."
15275,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Deck Officer. Deck Officer!
15276,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu..."
15277,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?
15278,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there.
15279,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?"
15280,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Why not?
15281,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, let's find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger."
15282,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
15283,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
15284,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,That's right. And my friends out in it.
15285,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Then I'll see you in hell!
15286,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up."
15287,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see. Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right."
15288,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope."
15289,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five... to one.
15290,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes... from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know... for a human being."
15291,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Ben?
15292,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Dagobah system?
15293,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Ben... Ben.
15294,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here."
15295,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Not much time.
15296,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Ben... Ben...
15297,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Hang on, kid."
15298,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Dagobah system...
15299,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Whew...
15300,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Dagobah...
15301,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"This may smell bad, kid..."
15302,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Yoda...
15303,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,...but it will keep you warm... til I get the shelter built. Ooh... I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
15304,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by.
15305,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Master Luke, sir, it's so good to see you fully functional again."
15306,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Artoo expresses his relief, also."
15307,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark."
15308,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Thanks to you.
15309,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"That's two you owe me, junior."
15310,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer."
15311,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.
15312,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
15313,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"I don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain."
15314,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Laugh it up, fuzzball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage."
15315,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,She expressed her true feelings for me.
15316,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"My...! Why, you stuck up,... half- witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf- herder!"
15317,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Who's scruffy-looking? I must have hit pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?"
15318,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?"
15319,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Take it easy.
15320,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Excuse us, please."
15321,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.
15322,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"It could be a speeder, one of ours."
15323,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code."
15324,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out."
15325,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Afraid there's not much left.
15326,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,What was it?
15327,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct.
15328,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,An Imperial probe droid.
15329,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.
15330,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Okay, that's it. Try it... Off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Off!"
15331,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports."
15332,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Thanks.
15333,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?"
15334,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Hi, kid. There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. You all right?"
15335,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Yeah.
15336,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Be careful.
15337,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"You, too."
15338,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports."
15339,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood?"
15340,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Good luck.
15341,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Just like new, Dack. How about you?"
15342,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,I know what you mean.
15343,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.
15344,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"All right, boys, keep tight now."
15345,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now!"
15346,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"All right, I'm coming in."
15347,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Hobbie, you still with me?"
15348,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,That armor's too strong for blasters.
15349,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Rogue Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. All right, stand by, Dack."
15350,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Just hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable."
15351,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Dack? Dack!
15352,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Rogue Three.
15353,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass."
15354,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Steady, Rogue Two"
15355,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"I see it, Wedge. Good work."
15356,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice."
15357,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Evacuate remaining ground staff.
15358,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. Right?"
15359,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And ... do take good care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear."
15360,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Rogue Two, are you all right?"
15361,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you.
15362,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Watch that cross fire, boys."
15363,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Stay tight and low.
15364,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Hobbie, I've been hit!"
15365,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,You all right?
15366,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Why are you still here?
15367,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,I heard the command center had been hit.
15368,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,You got your clearance to leave.
15369,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.
15370,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope."
15371,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters.
15372,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Come on... that's it.
15373,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports!
15374,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,Oh! Wait for me!
15375,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Transport, this is Solo. Better take off - I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon."
15376,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,But... but... but... where are you going? Uh... come back!!
15377,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop!
15378,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,How typical.
15379,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Come on.
15380,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident!"
15381,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,Wait! Wait!
15382,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,How's this?
15383,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Would it helped if I got out and pushed?
15384,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,It might.
15385,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir, might I suggest that you..."
15386,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,It can wait.
15387,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
15388,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart."
15389,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout.
15390,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,See?
15391,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it."
15392,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Punch it!
15393,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff.
15394,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going."
15395,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course."
15396,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,We're not going to regroup with the others.
15397,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,We're going to the Dagobah system.
15398,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Yes, Artoo?"
15399,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.
15400,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,I saw them! I saw them!
15401,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Saw what?
15402,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us."
15403,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Sir, sir! Might I suggest..."
15404,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Shut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield!
15405,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them."
15406,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Prepare to make the jump to light- speed.
15407,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"But, sir!"
15408,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,They're getting closer!
15409,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Oh yeah? Watch this.
15410,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Watch what?
15411,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,I think we're in trouble.
15412,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier that the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!"
15413,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,We're in trouble!
15414,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Horizontal boosters...! Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it. Bring me the hydrospanners!
15415,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.
15416,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Oww! Chewie!
15417,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,That was no laser blast! Something hit us.
15418,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"Han, get up here!"
15419,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Come on, Chewie!"
15420,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Asteroids!
15421,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven- one."
15422,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field?
15423,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?"
15424,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,You don't have to do this to impress me.
15425,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one."
15426,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Never tell me the odds!
15427,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be it, sweetheart."
15428,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
15429,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,I'm not going to argue with that.
15430,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,Pulverized?
15431,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,I'm going in closer to one of those big ones.
15432,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Closer?
15433,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,Closer?!
15434,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Oh, this is suicide!"
15435,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,There. That looks pretty good.
15436,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,What looks pretty good?
15437,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Yeah. That'll do nicely.
15438,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?"
15439,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,I hope you know what you're doing.
15440,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Yeah, me too."
15441,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Yes, that's it. Dagobah."
15442,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"No, I'm not going to change my mind about this. I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there..."
15443,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids."
15444,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle..."
15445,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around."
15446,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Artoo?
15447,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Artoo! Where are you?
15448,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Artoo! You be more careful.
15449,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Artoo - that way!
15450,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Artoo!
15451,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste very good. Anything broken?"
15452,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy."
15453,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.
15454,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but... does that include shutting me down, too?"
15455,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive."
15456,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable."
15457,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive."
15458,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most..."
15459,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Let go.
15460,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Sshh!
15461,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"Let go, please."
15462,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Don't get excited.
15463,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited."
15464,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else."
15465,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go.
15466,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Now all I have to do is find this Yoda... if he even exists.
15467,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Still... there's something familiar about this place. I feel like... I don't know...
15468,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Like we're being watched!
15469,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,I'm looking for someone.
15470,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Right.
15471,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.
15472,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner!
15473,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just..."
15474,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh... you're making a mess. Hey, give me that!"
15475,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.
15476,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Oh, Artoo, let him have it!"
15477,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Artoo!
15478,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do."
15479,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
15480,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,You know him?
15481,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo."
15482,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?"
15483,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it."
15484,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Well, of course I'll have to replace it."
15485,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Here! And Chewie...
15486,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,... I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.
15487,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help."
15488,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Would you please stop calling me that?
15489,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Sure, Leia."
15490,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes."
15491,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right."
15492,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Occasionally... ... when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
15493,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.
15494,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Stop that.
15495,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Stop what?
15496,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Stop that! My hands are dirty.
15497,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?"
15498,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Afraid?
15499,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,You're trembling.
15500,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,I'm not trembling.
15501,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.
15502,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,I happen to like nice men.
15503,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,I'm a nice man.
15504,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"No, you're not. You're..."
15505,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling."
15506,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Thank you. Thank you very much.
15507,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir."
15508,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now."
15509,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?
15510,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Mostly because of my father, I guess."
15511,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. Oh, I don't know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time."
15512,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Yoda! I am ready. I... Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready."
15513,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,But I've learned so much.
15514,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,I won't fail you - I'm not afraid.
15515,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion..."
15516,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio."
15517,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,There's something out there.
15518,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Where?
15519,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"Outside, in the cave."
15520,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,There it is. Listen! Listen!
15521,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,I'm going out there.
15522,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Are you crazy?!
15523,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart.
15524,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Then I'm going with you.
15525,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no."
15526,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all.
15527,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,There's an awful lot of moisture in here.
15528,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.
15529,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Yeah.
15530,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Watch out!
15531,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables."
15532,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Mynocks?
15533,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.
15534,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly little thing. Shoo! Shoo!
15535,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Wait a minute...
15536,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!"
15537,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...
15538,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,No time to discuss this in committee.
15539,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,I am not a committee!
15540,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,You can't make the jump to light- speed in this asteroid field...
15541,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!"
15542,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,Look!
15543,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"I see it, I see it."
15544,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,We're doomed!
15545,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,The cave is collapsing.
15546,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,This is no cave.
15547,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,What?
15548,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Vader. Is the dark side stronger?
15549,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
15550,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,But tell me why I can't...
15551,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,There's something not right here.
15552,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"I feel cold, death."
15553,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,What's in there?
15554,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field."
15555,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One... two... three!
15556,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,It's not fair!
15557,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!
15558,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,No light-speed?
15559,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,It's not my fault.
15560,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for."
15561,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Turn her around.
15562,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield.
15563,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,You're going to attack them?!
15564,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer..."
15565,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Shut up!
15566,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Oh, no. We'll never get it out now."
15567,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different."
15568,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"All right, I'll give it a try."
15569,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,I can't. It's too big.
15570,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,You want the impossible.
15571,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,I don't... I don't believe it.
15572,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?"
15573,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.
15574,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,I really don't see how that is going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...
15575,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Thank you.
15576,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,What did you have in mind for your next move?
15577,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away."
15578,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,With the rest of the garbage. Then what?
15579,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas?
15580,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,No. Where are we?
15581,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,The Anoat system.
15582,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Anoat system. There's not much there.
15583,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando."
15584,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Lando system?
15585,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him."
15586,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Thanks.
15587,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it."
15588,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,A mining colony?
15589,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me."
15590,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Can you trust him?
15591,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that."
15592,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!"
15593,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them."
15594,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Han! Leia!
15595,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,I saw... I saw a city in the clouds.
15596,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,They were in pain.
15597,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Future? Will they die?
15598,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,I've got to go to them.
15599,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian."
15600,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.
15601,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Rather touchy, aren't they?"
15602,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,I thought you knew this person.
15603,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that."
15604,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Thank you.
15605,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me."
15606,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Who's worried?
15607,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,Oh. No one to meet us.
15608,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,I don't like this.
15609,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Well, what would you like?"
15610,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Well, they did let us land."
15611,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me."
15612,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"See? My friend. Keep your eyes open, okay?"
15613,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Well, he seems very friendly."
15614,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Yes... very friendly.
15615,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Ahh... repairs. I thought you could help me out.
15616,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square."
15617,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Leia.
15618,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"All right, all right, you old smoothie."
15619,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your..."
15620,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Well, really!"
15621,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Hyperdrive.
15622,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Good.
15623,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?
15624,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh?"
15625,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Yeah.
15626,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.
15627,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,How rude!
15628,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if...
15629,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Hello? How interesting. Oh, my."
15630,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I... I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!"
15631,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've got to help them.
15632,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
15633,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,But I can help them! I feel the Force!
15634,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word."
15635,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,And that is why I have to go.
15636,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,You won't.
15637,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,And sacrifice Han and Leia?
15638,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"I understand. Artoo, fire up the converters."
15639,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,I will. And I'll return. I promise.
15640,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape.
15641,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.
15642,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.
15643,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,I don't trust Lando.
15644,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone."
15645,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?"
15646,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,What happened?
15647,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Where? Found him in a junk pile?
15648,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?"
15649,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Lando's got people who can fix him.
15650,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"No, thanks."
15651,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Not really.
15652,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Thank you.
15653,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,No. No problem. Why?
15654,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,So you're part of the mining guild then?
15655,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?
15656,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"I'm sorry, too."
15657,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"No, Threepio's with them."
15658,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Just hang on. We're almost there.
15659,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no... Please don't get up. No!"
15660,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!"
15661,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough..."
15662,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,I feel terrible.
15663,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Why are they doing this?
15664,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,They never even asked me any questions.
15665,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Lando.
15666,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Get out of here, Lando!"
15667,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Over to you?
15668,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,What about Han?
15669,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Vader wants us all dead.
15670,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Luke?
15671,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,And we're the bait.
15672,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you? My friend!"
15673,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Yeah, you're a real hero."
15674,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,You certainly have a way with people.
15675,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish."
15676,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,What's going on... buddy?
15677,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!"
15678,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!"
15679,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die."
15680,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,"Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey!"
15681,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess - you have to take care of her. You hear me?
15682,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,I love you!
15683,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,HAN,I know.
15684,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"What... what's going on? Turn round, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh... they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is."
15685,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"Luke! Luke, don't - it's a trap! It's a trap!"
15686,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,What do you think you're doing?
15687,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,I knew all along it had to be a mistake.
15688,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you?
15689,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!"
15690,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice."
15691,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,We don't need any of your help.
15692,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,What?
15693,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,It sounds like Han.
15694,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Chewie.
15695,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee."
15696,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?
15697,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Turn around, you wooly...! Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!"
15698,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me!"
15699,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!"
15700,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,You'll find I'm full of surprises.
15701,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,No!
15702,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system."
15703,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal.
15704,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"What are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump."
15705,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!
15706,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt. Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!"
15707,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I've looked better."
15708,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,I'll never join you!
15709,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,He told me enough! It was you who killed him.
15710,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!
15711,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,No! No! No!
15712,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Ben... Ben, please!"
15713,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Ben. Leia!
15714,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Hear me! Leia!
15715,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Luke... We've got to go back.
15716,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,I know where Luke is.
15717,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"Chewie, just do it."
15718,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch."
15719,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,"Okay. Easy, Chewie."
15720,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Lando?
15721,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Oh, Leia."
15722,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,I'll be back.
15723,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,Star Destroyer.
15724,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,If your people fixed the hyperdrive.
15725,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LEIA,All the coordinates are set. It's now or never.
15726,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed?
15727,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?
15728,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!"
15729,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Father.
15730,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
15731,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,It's Vader.
15732,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
15733,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur!"
15734,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,C-3PO,"Oh, you did it!"
15735,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Good luck, Lando"
15736,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine.
15737,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal."
15738,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,"Take care, you two. May the Force be with you."
15739,Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back,LUKE,Ow!
15740,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Tal'ama parqual! The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her."
15741,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Parqual zatana! A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening. BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching a tennis match. Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch. Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. The Teedo freaks out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and says, fiercely:"
15742,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Shhhh. BB-8 quiets instantly. The two watch the Teedo head off. Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. She KNEELS to him."
15743,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts. He has no respect for anyone. Your antenna's bent. (considers BB-8 for the first time,"
15744,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north, you'll drown in the sand."
15745,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Don't follow me. Town is that way. No! She heads off again. Finally he BEEPS to her -- something SWEET this time. That he is alone, scared, has no one else. This makes her stop. She turns and looks at him. Not liking him. But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, ""Come on."" BB-8 quickly moves to her. They head off together."
15746,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"In the morning, you go."
15747,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Don't give up. He still might show up. Whoever it is you're waiting for. Classified. I know all about waiting. BB-8 BEEPTALKS a question.
15748,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"For my family. They'll be back. One day. Come on. She tries to force a smile, but can't, really. She heads off. BB-8 BEEPS... then heads after her."
15749,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,What about him?
15750,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Actually... the droid's not for sale.
15751,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"""Finn."" Yeah, ""Finn"", I like that! I like that!"
15752,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Good to meet you, Poe!"
15753,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Hold on! I see it!
15754,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Where are you going?
15755,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,No no no! We can't go back to Jakku! We need to get outta this system! NEAR-MISS LASER BLASTS as Poe pilots aggressively.
15756,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,What - a droid?!
15757,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important!
15758,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can! We go back to Jakku, we die!"
15759,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Oh, you gotta be kidding me!!! I-- Suddenly BAM! THEY ARE HIT!"
15760,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Poe! Poe! Finn scrambles over the massive dune to the TIE FIGHTER, SMOKING AND ON FIRE, small debris around it. He thinks he sees POE'S ARM -- he pulls on it, but it's JUST POE'S JACKET. He throws that off and tries to find a way in -- even a way to LOOK INSIDE, but the smoke and heat make it impossible."
15761,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Poe!!! POE! Suddenly the ship BEGINS TO SINK -- like it's being CONSUMED INTO QUICKSAND -- Finn is slipping in too --
15762,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Water... water... water.. He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like creature DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted."
15763,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"-- Awgh, GAH! But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE. ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphatically"
15764,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Who? Him? Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant. Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT HIM, quarterstaff in hand. Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF! Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She holds the staff on him threateningly:"
15765,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"What's your hurry, thief?"
15766,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"What--?! Thief? BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES"
15767,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,OW! HEY! What?!
15768,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,The jacket! This droid says you stole it!
15769,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"I've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me -- OW!!! (BB-8 has ZAPPED him"
15770,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Where'd you get it? It belongs to his master. Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard decision: to tell the truth."
15771,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"It belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right? Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more."
15772,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,He was captured... by the First Order! I helped him escape but our ship crashed.
15773,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,So you're with the Resistance?
15774,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with the Resistance, yeah."
15775,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,I've never met a Resistance fighter before.
15776,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Well, this is what we look like. Some of us. Others look different."
15777,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"BB-8 says he's on a secret mission, he has to get back to your base."
15778,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, and everyone's after it. She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks:"
15779,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth. Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees.
15780,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"What is it? Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY! Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents:"
15781,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,What are you doing?!
15782,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Come on! Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT, SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS -- MORE BLASTS as they run!"
15783,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Come on, BB-8!"
15784,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Let go of me!
15785,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"No, we gotta move!"
15786,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"I know how to run without you holding my hand! BB-8 stay close! This way! Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing them! They disappear through a tent. TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET."
15787,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,They're shooting at both of us!
15788,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Yeah, they saw you with me! You're marked!"
15789,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Well, thanks for that!"
15790,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! Does anyone have blasters around here?!
15791,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Stop taking my hand!
15792,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Hey! As Finn comes to, he sees her. Through his fog:"
15793,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,-- Are you okay? And that very question touches her -- having never in her life been asked it.
15794,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Yeah. Follow me. Grateful, Finn takes it. They're off. LOCALS run amok as TIE fighters DIVE BOMB. REY, Finn and BB-"
15795,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"We can't outrun them! Rey POINTS to a parked, four-engine SHIP ahead:"
15796,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,We might in that quad-jumper!
15797,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,We need a pilot!
15798,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,We've got one!
15799,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"You?! (then, indicates one"
15800,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"That one's garbage! They run for the JUMPER but the passing TIE FIGHTERS FIRE AT IT, BLOWING IT APART IN A HUGE FLAME BALL! Rey, coming to a quick stop, RIGHT UP TO CAMERA:"
15801,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"The garbage'll do! She turns and runs back -- Finn and BB-8 follow as they all run toward the piece of junk -- and we see it for the first time: THE MILLENNIUM FALCON! TIE fighters BANK AROUND AGAIN. Finn, Rey and BB-8 run up the ramp of the semi-tarped Falcon."
15802,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Gunner position's down there!
15803,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,No! This ship hasn't been flown in years!
15804,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Great. Whoa! I can do this, I can do this--"
15805,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"I can do this, I can do this-- Rey pulls the yoke:"
15806,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay low!
15807,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Stay low! It confuses their tracking! For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to the co-pilot controls -- THE FALCON CANTS!"
15808,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"BB-8, hold on! Rey finally REACHES the switches, returns to the yoke, stabilizing the ship, afraid of this next move."
15809,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,What are you doing back there? Are you ever gonna fire back?!
15810,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"I'm working on it! Are the shields up? Rey strains, reaching for something in the co-pilot seat."
15811,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Not so easy without a co-pilot! Finn struggles with the gun controls and SWEEPING CHAIR:
15812,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Try sitting in this thing! Finn finally FIRES BACK at the two TIE FIGHTERS!
15813,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"We need cover, quick!"
15814,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,We're about to get some!
15815,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Damn it! Rey maneuvers the ship deeper into the graveyard.
15816,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Come on... come on... -- HITS AND SHATTERS the TIE FIGHTER!
15817,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Nice shot!
15818,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,I'm getting pretty good at this!
15819,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"The cannon's stuck in forward position, I can't move it! You gotta lose 'em!"
15820,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Get ready!
15821,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Okay! For what?
15822,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Oh no! Just as the TIE PILOT GETS A LOCK, Rey YANKS THE YOKE --"
15823,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Whooo! The Falcon ROARS OFF, victorious, leaving the ship graveyard and disappearing into the clouds."
15824,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,You're ok. He's with the Resistance. He's going to get you home. We both will.
15825,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Finn. What's yours.
15826,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,I'm Rey. BB-8 looks at him: really? Finn is reminded: HE'S LIED TO HER. She looks at Finn with a sweet smile.
15827,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Rey... But before Finn can say anything they JUMP: across the lounge, STEAM BURSTS from under the grating."
15828,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Help me with this! Quick! They hurry to the grating, PULL IT UP together. BB-8 rolls over, watches."
15829,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Whoa! What's going on? She goes below as BB-8 BEEPS concern.
15830,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris wrench -- check in there! As he checks a storage box, she disappears down below, overwhelmed by the technical issues --"
15831,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,How bad is it?!
15832,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"If we wanna live, not good! BB-8 watches as Finn searches A SELECTION OF TOOLS:"
15833,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"They're hunting for us now, we gotta get outta this system! Rey re-emerges, Finn hands her the wrench."
15834,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is ""need to know"" -- if I'm taking you there, I need to know!"
15835,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"This? She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8 alone. He contemplates telling her the truth. This is his moment. But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently:"
15836,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,You gotta tell us where the base is.
15837,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Pilex driver, hurry! Finn moves for the tool."
15838,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,So where's your base?
15839,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Go on BB-8, tell her."
15840,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"The Ileenium system? Finn hands her the tool, surprised but thrilled -- Rey disappears below again."
15841,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one -- get us there as fast as you can. A smiling Finn gives BB-8 a THUMBS UP. BB-8 quickly extends his WELDING TORCH and TURNS IT UPWARD, then retracts it."
15842,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal. I need the bonding tape, hurry!"
15843,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,What about you?
15844,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,I gotta get back to Jakku!
15845,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,BACK TO JAK--?! Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku?! !
15846,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"No, that one! No. No. The one I'm pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we don't patch it up, the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas! Bb-8 has moved to Finn -- TIPS HIS HEAD, shows him the tool. He throws her the tape, she disappears below:"
15847,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,This?
15848,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Yes!
15849,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Hey. Rey. You're a pilot -- you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend? The STEAM and ALARM STOP as Rey pops up, annoyed:"
15850,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"None of your business, THAT'S WHY! But then: ALL THE SHIP POWER GOES OUT. BB-8 is nervous."
15851,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,... That can't be good.
15852,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Someone's locked onto us -- all controls are overridden. Finn quickly, awkwardly climbs up, looks out."
15853,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Get off. Get off! See anything?
15854,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,... Oh no.
15855,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,It's the First Order.
15856,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,What do we do-- there must be
15857,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,You said poisonous gas --
15858,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"-- Yeah, but I fixed that --"
15859,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Can you unfix it? Rey stares at him -- and gets his plan! They head off --
15860,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"C'mon BB-8. They help BB-8 down, too: they both struggle like crazy, he weighs a TON."
15861,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,I got it.
15862,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Oooh...
15863,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,I'm okay. BB-8 get off me...
15864,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,You think this'll work on the Stormtroopers?
15865,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke, not toxins. LIGHTS COME ON! SOUND of the SHIP RAMP LOWERING! Finn PULLS THE GRATING CLOSED as he says:"
15866,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Hurry!
15867,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"I'm hurrying! Suddenly the FALCON DOOR OPENS -- AND HAN SOLO AND CHEWBACCA BOARD THE FALCON, weapons at the ready. PUSH IN ON THEM, ready for combat, operating silently, with hand signals only."
15868,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Chewie, we're home. Han gives Chewie a nod to check out the ship. Chewie heads off one way, Han in another. The grating above LIFTS OFF -- hands in surrender, they look up at Han, who's training his blaster on them, threatening. They're SCARED."
15869,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Where are the others? Where's the pilot?
15870,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,...I'm the pilot...
15871,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,You? Chewie MOAN-TALKS. Rey responds to him --
15872,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"No, it's true: we're the only ones on board."
15873,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,You can understand that thing?
15874,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"And ""that thing"" can understand you too, so watch it. Come on outta there. They climb up -- BB-8 uses his magnetic arm to quickly pull himself out."
15875,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Where'd you get this ship?
15876,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Niima Outpost.
15877,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Jakku?! That junkyard?
15878,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Thank you! Junkyard!
15879,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"I stole it from Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain."
15880,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good. Han walks away, takes in the ship: it's his again. Doesn't see that Rey is awed. His back to all of them, he smiles. Chewie responds as Han heads toward the cockpit."
15881,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,This is the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo?
15882,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,I used to be.
15883,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Han Solo? The Rebellion General?
15884,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"No, the smuggler!"
15885,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs...!
15886,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Twelve! Fourteen. A moment of private joy. Then he sees something that ANNOYS
15887,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Hey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line! Han moves to the corridor.
15888,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a mistake too, puts too much stress on"
15889,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Wait! No -- we need your help!
15890,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,My help?
15891,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible!
15892,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker. Yup: Han stops in his tracks.
15893,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion. You knew him. The mention of Luke has really hit Han. He turns to Finn.
15894,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke. Suddenly: a distant, METALLIC KA-CHUNK!"
15895,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten
15896,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Wait -- a what?! Did you just say Rathtars? Hey!
15897,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you?"
15898,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"I'm hauling Rathtars. On the CONTROL PANEL: IMAGES ON SCREENS FROM ALL AROUND THE SHIP. Including the EXTERIOR, where a TRANSPORT SHIP is LANDING ON THE FREIGHTER. Han is fearful."
15899,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Oh great. It's the Guavian Death Gang -- they must've tracked us from Nantoon. Han heads off as:
15900,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,What's a Rathtar?
15901,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?!
15902,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,No.
15903,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Good. They turn a corner:
15904,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,I got three of 'em going to King Prana.
15905,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,THREE?! How'd you get them on board?
15906,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"I used to have a bigger crew. Chewie GROAN-TALKS, concurring."
15907,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Get below deck and stay there until I say so -- don't even think about taking the Falcon.
15908,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,What about BB-8?
15909,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"He stays with me -- until I get rid of the gang, then you can have him back and be on your way."
15910,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"What about the Rathtars... where are you keeping them? A TERRIFYING BAM: a GROTESQUE RATHTAR GIANT TONGUE SLAMS into the CARGO CONTAINER window behind Finn, whose heart stops."
15911,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,There's one.
15912,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,What are you gonna do?
15913,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Same thing I always do: talk my way out of it.
15914,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Bala-Tik. What's the problem?
15915,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Can you see them?
15916,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,No. They start crawling down the crawl space.
15917,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,You know you can't trust those little freaks! How long've we known each other? Rey and Finn arrive under the gang. They WHISPER:
15918,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,They have blasters...
15919,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,A lot of 'em. We RISE THROUGH THE FLOOR to see the GANG and Han and company in the distance.
15920,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap? I spent that money.
15921,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!
15922,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Tasu Leech. Good to see you. Tasu speaks an alien language, we SUBTITLE:"
15923,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Boys. You're both gonna get what I promised! Have I ever not delivered for you before?
15924,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,What was the second time?
15925,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"First I've heard of it. Below the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid. Above, another Kanjiklubber says :"
15926,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Wait wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs!"
15927,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Close the blast doors from here?
15928,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Resetting the fuses should do it. Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as they do. Finn quickly joins in. Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too. DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a GIANT RATHTAR -- an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS --"
15929,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"... I got a bad feeling about this... Suddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN -- even down below, where Rey realizes it hasn't gone as planned."
15930,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Oh no.
15931,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Oh no, what?"
15932,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,This was a mistake!
15933,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Huge!
15934,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,What do they look like?
15935,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,They look like that. Finn yanks her away. They race around another corner -- a
15936,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,This way!
15937,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Are you sure? They scream and run off -- but Finn is GRABBED, PULLED AWAY"
15938,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Finn!
15939,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,It had me! But the door--!
15940,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,That was lucky! ANOTHER CORRIDOR - Finn and Rey run towards the Falcon.
15941,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"I got the door. Cover us! Chewie GROAN-AGREES. Chewie FIRES DOWN THE HALL as Han CROSSES THE CORRIDOR, BB-8 following nervously. As Chewie exchanges blaster fire, Han works the controls. THE HATCH OPENS -- just as CHEWIE IS HIT IN THE SHOULDER BY ENEMY FIRE! He goes down with a"
15942,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Chewie! You okay? Han GRABS CHEWIE'S BOWCASTER, FIRES at the DOOR CONTROLS,"
15943,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Wow. Come on! Come on!
15944,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Han! Finn and Rey race past BB-8 -- as they go up the ramp, Han says to Rey:"
15945,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"You, close the door behind us!"
15946,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Hey, where are you going?"
15947,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too -- if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere.
15948,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"I hate that guy. Han sits as, Rey hitting buttons:"
15949,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,And you could use a co-pilot.
15950,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"I got one, he's back there."
15951,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Watch the thrust, we're goin' out of here at lightspeed --"
15952,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,I never ask that question until after I've done it. A RATHTAR JUMPS ONTO THE WINDSHIELD -- REY SCREAMS! Its GIANT MOUTH CHEWING AT THE GLASS! Han works the controls:
15953,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"This is not how I thought this day was gonna go -- angle the shields -- Hang on back there! IN THE LOUNGE, Chewie is in pain -- Finn going through a first aid kit -- the ship is HIT again --"
15954,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Come on baby, don't let me down! He hits a switch -- but NOTHING."
15955,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"What?! But Rey reaches over, hits a switch, matter-of-factly."
15956,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Compressor. Han doesn't like it but she's right -- he hits the switch again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES! The hangar is FILLED WITH LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the ATTACKING GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES. In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we CUT TO:
15957,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Electrical overload!
15958,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,I can fix that!
15959,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,The coolant's leaking!
15960,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank--
15961,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"-- Secondary tank, I got it!"
15962,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Chewie, come on! I need help with this giant hairy thing! Stop moving! Chewie!"
15963,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me!"
15964,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Hurt him?! He almost killed me six times! Which is fine.
15965,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems. Han at the controls when all the alarms STOP. Rey, satisfied, sits in the co-pilot seat. Han is confused."
15966,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,What'd you do?
15967,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"I by-passed the compressor. He looks at her. A little, appreciative laugh. Han exits, walking past BB-8."
15968,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Move, Ball."
15969,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Nah, don't say that, you did great. Just rest. Han turns to Finn, who sits at the HOLOCHESS set, BB-8 beside him. This is awkward for Han, but damn, he means it:"
15970,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Good job, kid. And thanks."
15971,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"You're welcome. Finn has accidentally hit a button on the chess set, and the PIECES appear, looking up at Finn, curiously. The pieces start to FIGHT as Finn fiddles with the controls, trying to turn it off."
15972,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"So, fugitives, huh?"
15973,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,The First Order wants the map.
15974,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Finn is with the Resistance...
15975,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Let's see whatcha got.
15976,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"This map's not complete. It's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared, people have been looking for him."
15977,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Why'd he leave?
15978,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"He was training a new generation of Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible... He walked away from everything."
15979,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Do you know what happened to him?
15980,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,There're a lot of rumors. Stories. The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple.
15981,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,The Jedi were real?
15982,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"I used to wonder that myself. Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo -- magical power holding together good, evil, the dark side and the light."
15983,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"No, you rest. You want my help? You're getting it. Gonna see an old friend. She'll get your droid home. This is our stop. Han leaves towards the cockpit, Rey and Finn following."
15984,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Hey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're walking into here --"
15985,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"D'you just call me ""Solo""?"
15986,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Sorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? First Order sympathizers?"
15987,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Listen big deal, you've got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Hands him a BLASTER."
15988,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Always. Han walks off. Finn watches him go, wracked with guilt."
15989,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,You might need this.
15990,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,I think I can handle myself.
15991,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it. Rey picks it up. Grips it.
15992,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,You know how to use one of these?
15993,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Yeah, you pull the trigger."
15994,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,There's a little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name?
15995,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Rey.
15996,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Rey. I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, appreciates the Falcon."
15997,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Are you offering me a job?
15998,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't pay much.
15999,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,You're offering me a job.
16000,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,I'm thinking about it. Rey wants to say yes. But something stops her. A line she can't cross.
16001,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Well?
16002,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"If you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home. Han looks at her, questioningly."
16003,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Jakku? Rey looks off, in thought. Yeah, Jakku."
16004,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you. Han heads off. HOLD on Rey.
16005,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Solo, why are we here again?"
16006,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,To get your droid on a clean ship.
16007,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Clean?
16008,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata is our best bet."
16009,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"We can trust her, right?"
16010,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Relax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. And whatever you do, don't stare..."
16011,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Any of it. The door opens. Music. Madness. And...
16012,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Oh boy. Hey, Maz! NOISE returns. Maz walks to them, pushes someone away."
16013,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Chewie's working on the Falcon.
16014,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia."
16015,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Leia doesn't want to see me.
16016,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Please, we came here for your help."
16017,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,What fight?
16018,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"There is no fight against the First Order! Not one we can win. Look around. There's no chance we haven't been recognized already. I bet you the First Order is on their way right-- Finn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing him -- her eyes get HUGE."
16019,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"What's this? What are you doing? Maz adjusts the goggles again. Her eyes get impossibly BIGGER. She grunts recognition. She hoists herself on the tabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards Finn."
16020,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Solo, what is she doing?"
16021,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"I don't know, but it ain't good."
16022,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen.
16023,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"You don't know the First Order like I do. They'll slaughter us. We all need to run. Rey is stunned. Maz, not so much. She crawls back to her chair. She points to some pirates in the corner."
16024,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Finn!
16025,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Come with me.
16026,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,What about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base.
16027,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,I can't. Finn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han.
16028,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Keep it, kid. Finn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses back to normal, and turns to Han."
16029,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim. Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting."
16030,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,What are you doing? Finn gets up to talk to her.
16031,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Don't leave without me.
16032,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,You can't just go. I won't let you.
16033,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,I'm not who you think I am.
16034,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Finn, what are you talking about?"
16035,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a Stormtrooper.
16036,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Right into you. And you looked at me like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was. But I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back. Rey, come with me."
16037,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Don't go.
16038,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Take care of yourself. Please. Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey watches Finn return to the aliens... And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks through it. Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked back at her one last time."
16039,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,What was that? I shouldn't have gone in there.
16040,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,I have to get back to Jakku.
16041,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Luke.
16042,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"I'm never touching that again. I don't want any part of this. And Rey runs off, passing Maz. Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and heads off, fast. BB-8 follows her. TIGHT ON MAZ, watching her go. Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl."
16043,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"It was the Republic. Han and Chewie turn as Finn arrives, moving quickly through the crowd. With dread:"
16044,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"The First Order, they've done it. Where's Rey?"
16045,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,What are you doing?
16046,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to go back, you're too important. They'll help you. Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER"
16047,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Where'd you get that?
16048,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Safety! SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS and retreats, calls to BB-8: BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more chasing Troopers!"
16049,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"You have to keep going, stay out of sight, I'll try to fight 'em off. I hope so, too. BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind a massive, mossy tree. TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE --"
16050,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Come on, Chewie! Maz turns to Finn:"
16051,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,I need a weapon. Maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER.
16052,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Hey, can I try that? Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers and sends them flying."
16053,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"You okay, Big deal?"
16054,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Thanks! But TEN STORMTROOPERS come over a RISE, BLASTERS AIMED."
16055,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,It's the Resistance. One X-WING in particular -- MARKED IN BLACK -- SWOOPS DOWN and takes out the parked TIE FIGHTERS and Troopers!
16056,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Quick! Chewie picks up his Bowcaster, Han takes the blaster. Shoots a Trooper."
16057,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Woohoo! YEAH! That's one helluva pilot!
16058,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"No, no, no, no... REY!! In crazed frustration, Finn stops running, watches the receding First Order ships, Rey their captive."
16059,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,He took her! Did you see that? He took her. She's gone!
16060,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,C-3PO,"Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See- Threepio! You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm. (sees Leia,"
16061,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,You changed your hair.
16062,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,Same jacket.
16063,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"No, new jacket. Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship. It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly:"
16064,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son. He was here. Leia hears this. Maz watches through the smoke."
16065,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Poe. Poe Dameron. They move to each other -- and embrace.
16066,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,You're alive!
16067,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,What happened to you?
16068,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"No, no, no. It wasn't just me."
16069,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Oh here.
16070,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Poe -- I need your help.
16071,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,"And I need to talk to him. That was incredibly brave, what you did. Renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life --"
16072,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of mine was taken prisoner--"
16073,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,"Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry. Finn is startled -- Poe jumps in:"
16074,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,We're desperate for anything you can tell us.
16075,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"That's where my friend was taken -- I've got to get there, fast."
16076,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,"And I will do everything I can to help, but first you must tell us all you know."
16077,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,C-3PO,"General, I regret to inform you, but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete. And even worse, it matches no charted system on record. We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke."
16078,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home.
16079,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Leia...
16080,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,Don't do that.
16081,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Do what? She heads off.
16082,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,"Anything. Flummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO."
16083,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,C-3PO,Princesses. Han follows Leia across the base floor:
16084,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,I'm trying to be helpful!
16085,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,When did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star.
16086,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,C-3PO,"BB-8. You're wasting your time. BB-8 looks up at C-3PO, who stands there. C-3PO SIGHS."
16087,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,C-3PO,It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data.
16088,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Listen to me, will you? I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him."
16089,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,You think I want to forget him? I want him back! Han looks at her with sympathy.
16090,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,There was nothing we could've done. There was too much Vader in him.
16091,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both.
16092,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was ever good at.
16093,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,We both did.
16094,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"We lost our son, forever."
16095,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,No.
16096,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,He seduced our son to the dark side. But we can still save him. Me. You.
16097,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"If Luke couldn't reach him, how could"
16098,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,Luke is a Jedi... you're his father. There's still light in him. I know it.
16099,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Where am I?
16100,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Where are the others?
16101,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask. Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment before she regains her own mask of defiance."
16102,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator --
16103,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,-- Get out of my head -- But this just makes Kylo lean closer.
16104,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,I'm not giving you anything.
16105,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"... You... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as... Darth Vader! KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on Kylo Ren, who starts to leave. And we PRELAP:"
16106,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. The Stormtrooper Guard looks at her. A beat."
16107,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. The Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER. Rey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or laughed at? The tension unbearable when the Guard says:"
16108,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open."
16109,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,And you will drop your weapon.
16110,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,So it's big.
16111,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"It uses the power of the sun. As the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears. An OFFICER runs up, hands Leia a DATACARD."
16112,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,"The First Order: they're charging the weapon again, now. Our system is the next target."
16113,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,C-3PO,"Oh my. Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed. They all react to this horrible news."
16114,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Okay, how do we blow it up? There's always a way to do that."
16115,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,Han's right. Han is surprised.
16116,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,There is one. All eyes on Finn as he moves around the hologram to a location on the Starkiller Base -- it is ZOOMED IN: A GIANT BLACK
16117,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Precinct 47. Here.
16118,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,We disable the shields.
16119,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,I can do it.
16120,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,I like this guy.
16121,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"I can disable the shields. But I have to be there, on the planet--"
16122,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,We'll get you there.
16123,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,"Han, how?"
16124,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"If I told you, you wouldn't like it."
16125,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Chewie, check that donal capitator. Come on. Let's go. -- Finn, be careful with those - they're explosives."
16126,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Now you tell me?
16127,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,"No matter how much we fought, I've always hated watching you leave. Han looks over, there's Leia."
16128,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"That's what I did it. So you'd miss me. She laughs, moves up close to him."
16129,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,"I did miss you. He looks at her, says sweetly, out of the blue:"
16130,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh? Some of it was...good."
16131,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,... Pretty good.
16132,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Some things never change.
16133,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,"If you see our son again, bring him home."
16134,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,How are we getting in?
16135,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through. Finn is suddenly filled with dread.
16136,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed?! Chewie, thinking it's crazy too, says: HELL YES WE ARE!"
16137,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Alright, Chewie, get ready. Chewie GROANS: he's ready. Han studies the PANEL INDICATORS."
16138,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,And Now! Chewie and Han hit switches --
16139,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"I get any higher, they'll see us! And the ship DIVES again, back into the trees!"
16140,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,The flooding tunnels are over that ridge. We'll get in that way.
16141,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,What was your job when you were based here?
16142,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Sanitation.
16143,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields?
16144,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,I don't. I'm just here to get Rey.
16145,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,People are counting on us! The galaxy is counting on us--!
16146,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll use the Force!"
16147,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,That's not how the Force works--!
16148,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Oh really, you're cold?"
16149,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Come on! They follow Finn on the snowy hike. On the horizon, THE"
16150,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"The longer we're here, less luck we're going to have. The shields?"
16151,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,I have an idea about that. Han and Chewie follow Finn.
16152,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Remember me?
16153,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Not anymore. The name's Finn, and I'm in charge. I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge."
16154,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Bring it down. Bring it down.
16155,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Follow me. Finn SMILES as we CUT TO:
16156,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,You want me to blast that bucket off your head? Lower the shields.
16157,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Do it. Chewie MOAN/TALKS. Phasma hits a few more buttons -- the controls BEEP-CLICK. ""SHIELDS DISABLE INITIATE"". Eyes on"
16158,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Solo, if this works, we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey."
16159,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Don't worry kid, we won't leave here without her. The controls BEEP-CLICK. ""SHIELDS DISABLED""."
16160,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,I disagree. What do we do with her?
16161,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Is there a garbage chute? Trash compactor?
16162,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Yeah, there is..."
16163,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,C-3PO,Thank the Maker!
16164,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,Han did it! Send them in!
16165,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover."
16166,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,You sure you're up for this?
16167,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,Hell no -- I'll go in find and try to find Rey -- -- The troopers'll be on our tail. We have to be ready for that. There's an access tunnel that'll leads -- (Han starts pointing with his chin to
16168,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Are you all right?
16169,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Yeah.
16170,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Good.
16171,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,What happened -- did he hurt you?
16172,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Finn. What are you doing here?!
16173,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,We came back for you. She is speechless -- this is all she's ever wanted anyone to do. Chewie TALKS -- and Rey's eyes nearly tear up.
16174,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,What'd he say?
16175,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,... That it was your idea. Finn awkwardly smiles. It's his nature. They embrace.
16176,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,Thank you.
16177,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,How did you get away?
16178,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it.
16179,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Escape now. Hug later.
16180,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,They're in trouble. We can't leave. My friend here has a bag full of explosives. Let's use 'em.
16181,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,C-3PO,And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes! It would take a miracle to save us now.
16182,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,That girl knows her stuff.
16183,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"We'll set the charges at every other column. He GROAN/TALKS to Han, who looks around, reconsiders."
16184,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,You're right. That's a better idea. You take the top.
16185,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Ben! The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast catwalk. He turns."
16186,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,Take off that mask. You don't need it.
16187,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,The face of my son. Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED -- seeing the face of his son for the first time as a man.
16188,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. My son is alive. SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch."
16189,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you -- you know it's true. Kylo hesitates. Somehow, he does know it."
16190,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"No it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you. For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears flood his stoic eyes..."
16191,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,HAN,"Yes. Anything. Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe it. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch"
16192,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"The Falcon's this way. Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy forest -- until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both out of breath. They look at each other. They both know: they can't run."
16193,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,You're a monster!
16194,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Rey! Rey! Rey... Rey... Oh no. Oh no no no... Finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. But the SOUND OF KYLO REN'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO KYLO REN, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE."
16195,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,FINN,"Come get it. Despite his fear, Finn raises his blade in welcome. Kylo Ren CHARGES at him - Finn terrified -- Kylo Ren LUNGES but Finn DEFLECTS Ren's SPARK-SPITTING blade! Kylo Ren TURNS, ATTACKS, CUTS -- amazingly Finn BLOCKS, COUNTER-ATTACKS -- clearly IMPRESSES KYLO REN, who only enjoys this challenge more! Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. Her eyes focus on the two men fighting, through the trees. Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks with a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE moves into OFFENSIVE ones. And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN! LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK -- wounded, but more enraged than weakened. Kylo Ren CHARGES AGAIN -- their WEAPONS POUND, SPARKS FLY, their blades LOCK, the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers: And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity -- Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness. Rey sees this -- Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF BLOWS, pushing Finn further and further back until he loses balance."
16196,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"The Force. Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them, she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER! Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES"
16197,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"Finn! Finn... Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless body in her arms. Snow flurries around them as she cries, holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores. They are left here to die -- nearby MORE TREES DROP as the planet continues to COLLAPSE. And just as it seems like all is lost... Her wet eyes look up to see:"
16198,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,C-3PO,R2-D2! You've come back! You found what? How dare you call me that!
16199,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,C-3PO,"(he swats R2-D2, who"
16200,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,C-3PO,"General? Excuse me, General? Leia turns to see droids."
16201,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,C-3PO,R2-D2 may contain some much needed good news.
16202,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,"Tell me. Rey stands with Leia, Poe C-3PO, BB-8 and a handful of Resistance Officers. Suddenly R2-D2 PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM! A"
16203,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,C-3PO,Oh! The map! It is complete!
16204,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,"-- Luke -- Suddenly there are CHEERS AND EMBRACES. C-3PO leans down to R2-D2 and says, quietly, sweetly:"
16205,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,C-3PO,Oh my dear friend. How I've missed you.
16206,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,REY,"We'll see each other again. I believe that. Thank you, my friend."
16207,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,Rey. Rey turns around.
16208,Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens,LEIA,May the Force be with you. This fills Rey up. She smiles gratefully. Rey crosses to the Falcon.
16209,Superbad,SETH,Yo.
16210,Superbad,EVAN,What's up?
16211,Superbad,SETH,"I was doing research last night, for next year, and I think I'm gonna go with Bang Bus."
16212,Superbad,EVAN,Which one's Bang Bus?
16213,Superbad,SETH,"The one where they bang the chicks on the bus. Thirteen bucks a month. Total access, live Web Cam feed. The works. It'll be like I'm on the bus, banging them myself."
16214,Superbad,EVAN,"That stuff's bullshit, they're all faking it. And plus, your parents are gonna look at the bill."
16215,Superbad,SETH,It shows up under a different name. I hope. Bang Bus.
16216,Superbad,SETH,That wouldn't look good. Maybe I should just pick the one with the least dirty sounding name.
16217,Superbad,EVAN,Weapons of Ass Destruction's out then.
16218,Superbad,SETH,I could tell my parents I'm doing a project on Rome and I have to research orgies.
16219,Superbad,EVAN,Yeah. Just tell them your taking a class on blow jobs.
16220,Superbad,SETH,Don't touch that!
16221,Superbad,SETH,"Yeah, you know. I got some other places. Good places. I think we'll be fine."
16222,Superbad,EVAN,Miss each other? No!
16223,Superbad,SETH,That's disgusting.
16224,Superbad,SETH,"I am truly, truly jealous that you got to suck on those tits when you were a baby."
16225,Superbad,EVAN,"Fuck you, man."
16226,Superbad,EVAN,"You're being an idiot, man. You really shouldn't park there."
16227,Superbad,SETH,Fuck it. I'm a senior about to graduate. They should be suckin' my balls. It's the least they can do for stealing three years of my life.
16228,Superbad,EVAN,What the hell's wrong with Dimitri?
16229,Superbad,SETH,"Oh, yeah dude, I forgot to tell you. I knocked the fuckin' shit out of him in capture the flag last week."
16230,Superbad,EVAN,"Good! 9th Grade Camp he gave me whiplash in ""King of the Ring."" I fucking hate that guy."
16231,Superbad,EVAN,Look at those nipples.
16232,Superbad,SETH,They're like baby toes.
16233,Superbad,EVAN,It's not fair. I have to hide every erection I get.
16234,Superbad,SETH,"Sometimes I get boners so big I can't hide them. And then I get nervous and my heart starts pounding, and it all just, like, feeds my boner. It just becomes this...thing...that's attached to me. And it won't go away."
16235,Superbad,EVAN,"Just imagine if girls weren't weirded out by our boners and they actually wanted to see `em, like this shit."
16236,Superbad,SETH,"You know it's been, like, a year and a half since I've seen an actual human female nipple. Besides my mom's. I saw it last month, and it was sick."
16237,Superbad,EVAN,"Holy shit. Liat was two years ago? I guess so. She was insanely hot, though."
16238,Superbad,SETH,Exactly. Too hot. That's what sucks.
16239,Superbad,EVAN,"How can that possibly suck? I'd be fuckin' psyched if I'd gotten with a girl that hot. You got, like, two dozen handjobs!"
16240,Superbad,SETH,"And three quarters of a blowjob, But that was fuckin' it. It was the peak of my ass- gettin' career, and it happened way, way, way too early."
16241,Superbad,EVAN,You're like Orson Welles.
16242,Superbad,SETH,"Exactly! If I'd built up to it, I'd probably at least be having steady sex with a mediocre-looking girl at this point. I honestly now see why Orson Welles ate his fat ass to death."
16243,Superbad,EVAN,"You'll have sex in college. Everyone does. And if not, you'll have the Bang Bus."
16244,Superbad,SETH,But the key is to be good at sex by the time you're in college. You don't want girls to think you suck dick at fucking.
16245,Superbad,EVAN,"I still think you've got a chance with Jules. She got mad hot over last summer, and clearly hasn't realized it, `cause she still flirts with you."
16246,Superbad,SETH,"Are you joking, man? Let's see here...she dated Dan Remick, Matt Muir, Josh Corber and what's-his-face. All of those were cool guys. She's been hot way longer than you think. Why would she end her high school career with me?"
16247,Superbad,EVAN,"Well, Helen got with Ariel Shafir."
16248,Superbad,SETH,"Yeah, and he was a complete fucking loser. You're a step up from that. Which is why you should stop being a pussy and do her! You could nailthe shit out of her for, like, two months before you leave. That bitch looks like a good fucker."
16249,Superbad,EVAN,"Hey! I'm sick of you talking about her like that, man!"
16250,Superbad,SETH,"What, you can talk about that bitch all day every single day, but I can't say one thing about her?"
16251,Superbad,EVAN,I don't constantly insult her.
16252,Superbad,SETH,I didn't insult her! I said she looks like a good fucker! She looks like she can take a dick. That's a good thing. Some women pride themselves on their dick- taking abilities.
16253,Superbad,SETH,No.
16254,Superbad,EVAN,Wow. You really bitched out on that one.
16255,Superbad,SETH,I bitched out? You bitched out! You were across the street before I even realized what was going on. That guy's such a douche bag.
16256,Superbad,SETH,This...is...bullshit.
16257,Superbad,EVAN,"Oh, don't worry, no worries. Just keep it. Then you'll just have it, and you won't have to borrow another pen."
16258,Superbad,EVAN,"Yeah, it's a maybe. But, you know, I gotta, I got my..."
16259,Superbad,EVAN,"there's so much other fun shit that is going to be going on that night...so, you know..."
16260,Superbad,EVAN,Because of all the other fun shit I'm off doing.
16261,Superbad,EVAN,"Dimitri's? I uh...didn't want to go, because, well, I did other stuff. Saturday... Oh yeah! Saturday night was awesome!"
16262,Superbad,EVAN,"First my parents went out to a double feature, so a bunch of people came over..."
16263,Superbad,EVAN,...and we had a couple drinks in my basement...
16264,Superbad,EVAN,"...and Seth's parents were having this cocktail party, and we went over there to, like, mingle..."
16265,Superbad,EVAN,"...and there were actually some really interesting and, like, entertaining people there..."
16266,Superbad,EVAN,"...and, uh, then we saw some, uh, live music."
16267,Superbad,EVAN,...then we went to a club downtown...
16268,Superbad,EVAN,...and then we pretty much called it a night and went home...
16269,Superbad,EVAN,...you would've loved it.
16270,Superbad,EVAN,"Yeah...well, you know, me and Seth are always cooking up...uh...fun little...events."
16271,Superbad,EVAN,"Nah. We were going to but, uh, we got into different ones."
16272,Superbad,EVAN,Same shit I've always been doing. It'll be fine. Don't worry about it. I'm not.
16273,Superbad,SETH,"Mrs. Grier, I joined this class because I thought I'd be cooking with a partner. It's not fair. She's never here. I don't get twice the marks for doing all the work."
16274,Superbad,SETH,Look at Evan.
16275,Superbad,SETH,"While I'm over in my unit, isolated and alone, eating my terrible-tasting food because I can't even properly mix ingredients by myself, I gotta look over at that."
16276,Superbad,SETH,I wash and dry. And that is B.S. I'm like a single mother.
16277,Superbad,SETH,Jules?
16278,Superbad,SETH,That's kind of a personal question.
16279,Superbad,SETH,Nothing. It was my attempt at humour.
16280,Superbad,SETH,"Well, I would call that a success. Marscampone... scamponee cheese? Is that some kind of new cheese or something?"
16281,Superbad,SETH,Except blue cheese. That stuff is sick.
16282,Superbad,SETH,"Well whoever ""they"" are, they can eat my dick."
16283,Superbad,SETH,"I don't know, probably nothing. Why?"
16284,Superbad,SETH,Yeah. Sure. That sounds fun. I love parties.
16285,Superbad,SETH,"Oh, uh. It's more of, like, a love-hate thing. Right now I love them, though. Uh...how do I do this?"
16286,Superbad,EVAN,"That's good shit. Huh, Miroki?"
16287,Superbad,SETH,Dude! She's havin' a fuckin' party.
16288,Superbad,SETH,Don't tell Fogell about the party.
16289,Superbad,FOGELL,"Hey guys, I was walking here, and on the way, I saw Nicola, and she was wearing these tight white pants and a black g- string and you could see it right through the pants."
16290,Superbad,FOGELL,It's nine thirty.
16291,Superbad,FOGELL,I told her what time it was. It was awesome. She's got the nicest ass.
16292,Superbad,SETH,Like you'd know what to do with it.
16293,Superbad,FOGELL,Ha ha. I'm really gonna miss your knee- slappers when me and Evan are at State.
16294,Superbad,SETH,"Yeah, well I'll be at Junior college where the girls are half as smart, and thus twice as likely to blow me."
16295,Superbad,FOGELL,What are you guys doing tonight?
16296,Superbad,SETH,Nothing. Sorry. You'll just have to fingerbang yourself.
16297,Superbad,EVAN,What you doing?
16298,Superbad,FOGELL,"Well, Seth always said I was too much of a pussy, but he was wrong. It's been arranged. At lunch, I'm going to the same place Mike Snider went to pick up my brand new false identification card."
16299,Superbad,SETH,"Dude! That's perfect, `cause, Evan, didn't you just say that you heard about a party?"
16300,Superbad,FOGELL,Why didn't you tell me?
16301,Superbad,SETH,Shut up. Who cares? Just be happy he told. And hey! Now you can buy the booze.
16302,Superbad,FOGELL,Sounds cool. Cool.
16303,Superbad,EVAN,"Well done, man. We'll see you after class."
16304,Superbad,SETH,Did you tell that nimrod you're not going to room with him?
16305,Superbad,EVAN,"Uh...no, not yet."
16306,Superbad,SETH,"You better, man. That guy is a poon-tang repellent."
16307,Superbad,SETH,We're getting a fake ID.
16308,Superbad,EVAN,"Actually, we're going to different schools."
16309,Superbad,SETH,Nothing! Jesus.
16310,Superbad,EVAN,Yeah? What do people think is gonna happen? That's what I don't get.
16311,Superbad,SETH,"We're not, like, dependent on each other."
16312,Superbad,EVAN,"We met when we were 8, we were fine before then. It's not like we do everything together."
16313,Superbad,EVAN,So it looks like we get a little graduation party after all.
16314,Superbad,SETH,I would do terrible things to get with Jules tonight. Terrible things.
16315,Superbad,EVAN,No shit. I'd give my left foot to start dating Helen. She's killin' me.
16316,Superbad,SETH,"Ah, Helen's a bitch."
16317,Superbad,EVAN,"I'm fuckin' sick of this shit, man! Seriously. Why do you hate her? Is there even an actual reason? Because seriously, I'm beginning you think you like her."
16318,Superbad,SETH,Hell no! I hate her.
16319,Superbad,EVAN,Why?
16320,Superbad,SETH,"I was never going to tell you this story, because I knew that if you heard it you would never want to get with Helen, but over the last few weeks I've been having a hard time thinking of a reason not to. So, here it is. Helen and I went to elementary school together, right? Well, in the third grade, I had...like...an odd problem. For some reason, I don't know why, I used to have this thing...where I would...like, kinda...sit around all day and draw pictures of dicks."
16321,Superbad,EVAN,What?
16322,Superbad,SETH,I'd just sit there for hours on end drawing dicks. I don't know what it was. I couldn't touch the pen to paper without it drawing a penis.
16323,Superbad,EVAN,That's fucked.
16324,Superbad,SETH,No shit that's fucked up. Here I am this little kid who can't stop drawing dicks to save his life.
16325,Superbad,EVAN,What does that have to do with Helen?
16326,Superbad,SETH,Just listen.
16327,Superbad,SETH,"I was very secretive about this dick thing I had going, after all, even I thought I was a loon, lord knows what other people would have thought. So I would take all my dick drawings and stick them in this Muppet lunch-box I had."
16328,Superbad,SETH,"So one day I was finishing up a picture of a real big and veiny bastard, when all of a sudden..."
16329,Superbad,EVAN,You hit Helen's foot with your dick?
16330,Superbad,SETH,Well she fucking flipped. She started crying and shit. Ratted me out.
16331,Superbad,SETH,"The principle finds my cock-Muppet lunch- box, and he fucking flips."
16332,Superbad,SETH,It turns out the principle was some crazy religious guy and he thought I was possessed by some dick devil or something.
16333,Superbad,SETH,"So, he calls my parents and they make me go to a psychologist who kept asking me all these dick questions. My parents wouldn't even let me eat dick-shaped foods for, like, months! No carrots, no Pop-sicles, no hot-dogs. You know how many fucking foods are shaped like dick?"
16334,Superbad,EVAN,Wow. That's really messed up.
16335,Superbad,SETH,I can't even stand to look at her punk face. I'm going to go take a piss. Peace.
16336,Superbad,SETH,Hey. Here I am.
16337,Superbad,SETH,Yeah. Why? Should I not?
16338,Superbad,SETH,Very right. Right. I'm getting that.
16339,Superbad,SETH,Ummm... I don't know. I... think...maybe.
16340,Superbad,SETH,"Well, funny thing about my back. It's located on my cock."
16341,Superbad,SETH,"Ha! Alright, sure. I can do that. What do you guys want?"
16342,Superbad,SETH,Wow. I would never even think of doing something that nice.
16343,Superbad,SETH,"Should I just get, like, a shitload of different shit?"
16344,Superbad,SETH,Yeah! I'll see you!
16345,Superbad,SETH,"Man, just - Evan, listen to me. You know Jules? You know what she just did? She came up to me and asked me if I would buy her alcohol. Not just her, her whole party. Do you know what that means? It means that by some miracle, we were paired up, we talked, and she actually thought of me afterwards. Thought of me enough to decide that I was the guy that she was going to trust the fun-ness of her party with. She wants me! She fucking wants my dick!"
16346,Superbad,EVAN,Did you ever think maybe she's just using you to get her alcohol?
16347,Superbad,SETH,Of course I thought of that! LISTEN TO THIS!
16348,Superbad,SETH,"She has an older brother! She could have asked him, but she asked me! She looked me straight in the face and asked me. She wants to fuck me, man. Do you understand that? Fucking! Today is the day that fucking has become possible."
16349,Superbad,EVAN,Are you stupid? You're not going to be able to sleep with her tonight.
16350,Superbad,SETH,"She's going to be at the party, she's gonna be drunk, and she likes me at least a little, so I can get with her. Then, I make her my girlfriend, and then I fuck her all summer long! Then, by the time college rolls around, I'm the fuckin' fucking master, man!"
16351,Superbad,EVAN,"Make her your girlfriend? Of course! That's good. So, hypnosis, love potion, or mind-control helmet?"
16352,Superbad,SETH,"Once I've gotten with her, I write her love letters, flowers, I'll do anything - I'll be the most pussy-whipped guy in the universe - what chick wouldn't go out with a guy like that?"
16353,Superbad,SETH,"Fuck off, Greg. Why don't you piss your pants again?"
16354,Superbad,SETH,Wanna hear the best part?
16355,Superbad,EVAN,"Oh, I haven't?"
16356,Superbad,SETH,Helen!
16357,Superbad,SETH,"You do the same thing, man! Buy Helen her alcohol. Then, tonight, when you guys are both drunk, get with her! This is the last party we're ever going to go to as high school people! I've fully ignored my hatred for Helen in coming up with this, which is a big ass deal. We need to stop being pussy and for once just goes balls out, man!"
16358,Superbad,EVAN,I should get Helen alcohol?
16359,Superbad,SETH,"Of course! It'll be pimp, and then you know she'll be drunk."
16360,Superbad,EVAN,Have you talked to Fogell?
16361,Superbad,SETH,"You talk to Helen, I'll find that retard Fogell."
16362,Superbad,EVAN,Hey Helen! Hold up. Did you hear about the party tonight?
16363,Superbad,EVAN,"No, no, I am. That's why I came looking for you. Me and some guys are going to the liquor store after class, so I was thinking I could buy you yours, if you needed someone to."
16364,Superbad,EVAN,You will absolutely not. It's my treat.
16365,Superbad,EVAN,"I'm sorry! Shit, shit. I'm so sorry! I just wanted to give you a friendly nudge in the arm, you know? I'm so sorry."
16366,Superbad,EVAN,Yeah. I'll see you then. I'm so sorry about that.
16367,Superbad,SETH,"That douche bag isn't back yet, I've been standing here with my thumb up my ass."
16368,Superbad,EVAN,"I did it, dude. I even offered to pay for it. It was pimp."
16369,Superbad,SETH,Whoa. That is fucking pimp. Why didn't I do that? Shit.
16370,Superbad,SETH,"That's what we get for trusting a mental midget! He's fucking it all up! I bet he pussied out, just like I said he would!"
16371,Superbad,SETH,"I mean, what are we going to tell the girls? ""Sorry, we couldn't do what we promised because we're dickless incompetents!"" We'll never get laid because of that little ass-fuck. How did he get in to State?! He's got shit for brains! Shit! How else can we get liquor?"
16372,Superbad,FOGELL,Hey guys!
16373,Superbad,EVAN,Where have you been?
16374,Superbad,SETH,"Yeah! You almost gave me a goddamn heart attack! You better fucking have it, where is it?"
16375,Superbad,FOGELL,"I got it. It's flawless! It's great, man, look."
16376,Superbad,EVAN,"Okay Mr...""McLovin""? What kind of a stupid name is that? What are you trying to be, an Irish R&B singer?"
16377,Superbad,FOGELL,"Well, they let you pick any name you want when you get there."
16378,Superbad,SETH,So you picked McLovin?
16379,Superbad,FOGELL,It was between that or Muhammad.
16380,Superbad,SETH,Why was it between that or Muhammad? Why didn't you just pick a common name?
16381,Superbad,FOGELL,"Actually, Seth, Muhammad is the most commonly used name on earth."
16382,Superbad,EVAN,Have you ever actually met a guy named Muhammad?
16383,Superbad,FOGELL,Have you actually ever met a guy named McLovin?
16384,Superbad,SETH,No! That's why you picked a bad name.
16385,Superbad,EVAN,You probably have federal agents tracking you for even considering the name Muhammad on a fake ID!
16386,Superbad,SETH,"Look at this shit man, you don't even have a first name. It just says ""NAME: MCLOVIN"""
16387,Superbad,EVAN,One name?
16388,Superbad,FOGELL,"I just thought McLovin sounded old, and the chicks would dig it."
16389,Superbad,EVAN,Under what circumstances would you ever have to show a chick your ID?
16390,Superbad,FOGELL,"She could ask. Or, I could just show it to her."
16391,Superbad,SETH,Holy shit! I don't believe this. This says you're fucking 25! Why didn't you just put 21?
16392,Superbad,FOGELL,"I knew you would ask that. Look, every day, dozens of kids roll into the liquor store with fake ID's trying to act like Joe Casual. Each and every one of these kids just so happens to be 21 years old. Just how many 21 year-olds do you think there are?"
16393,Superbad,SETH,Fool!
16394,Superbad,EVAN,"Calm down! It's not terrible! This might work, but it's up to you, Fogell. They'll either think, ""Oh, it's another punk kid with a fake ID."" Or, ""Look, it's McLovin, the twenty five year-old organ donor"". What's it gonna be?"
16395,Superbad,FOGELL,I am McLovin.
16396,Superbad,SETH,You're not McLovin. No one's McLovin and this is never going to work. We need a new way to get alcohol. Could we drive to Canada or something?
16397,Superbad,FOGELL,I still think it's going to work.
16398,Superbad,SETH,What the fuck? Where's my car?
16399,Superbad,EVAN,"I told you, man! What did I say? I told you that was a dumb idea."
16400,Superbad,FOGELL,Why would you park in the staff-
16401,Superbad,SETH,"Shut up, Fogell."
16402,Superbad,FOGELL,`Cause you're not staff.
16403,Superbad,SETH,"I am aware of that, Fagell."
16404,Superbad,FOGELL,Will you still pick me up from work?
16405,Superbad,SETH,Let's go to your house.
16406,Superbad,SETH,"Now we wait for your Mom to piss off and steal your parents' booze like your brother always does. Take a bit from every bottle. Piece of cake. It's not exactly what Jules wanted, but it'll do, right?"
16407,Superbad,EVAN,Come on! Just wear what you wore to school.
16408,Superbad,SETH,I told you I can't do that. I can't let Jules see me in the same shit I wore at school. It's completely unbecoming.
16409,Superbad,EVAN,Why don't you just go to your house and get your own clothes? `Cause this is stupid.
16410,Superbad,SETH,You're stupid! I can't go home. Then my mom will know the car got towed and I'll be grounded tonight. I'll just stay here all weekend and pick it up on Monday.
16411,Superbad,EVAN,"Where the fuck is the dirt bike? Ah, screw it. I'm just gonna kill everyone. Boom! Die, piggies!!!"
16412,Superbad,SETH,Don't you have bigger clothes?
16413,Superbad,EVAN,See what my dad's got.
16414,Superbad,SETH,"Not bad, eh?"
16415,Superbad,EVAN,"It's, like, 7:30 and my Mom's still here."
16416,Superbad,SETH,"Alright, here's what we'll do. I'll fuck your Mom in the basement while you steal the liquor."
16417,Superbad,EVAN,"Fuck you, asshole. Let's just sneak down there and grab it."
16418,Superbad,SETH,"Alright, dude. Get ready to receive."
16419,Superbad,EVAN,I can't believe it. They marked them.
16420,Superbad,SETH,"What do you mean they...oh, man! Your parents are fuckers. What do we do now?"
16421,Superbad,EVAN,"Shh!!! We...we...take some and fill it back up with water. Get ready, I'll get water."
16422,Superbad,EVAN,Gin? That stuff is literally undrinkable.
16423,Superbad,SETH,"It's the biggest bottle, you douche. Just do it! She's right in the other room!"
16424,Superbad,EVAN,Run!
16425,Superbad,SETH,"But, the booze?"
16426,Superbad,EVAN,Take it!
16427,Superbad,EVAN,"Bye, Mom! Love you."
16428,Superbad,SETH,Look at this mother. Smell it's glory.
16429,Superbad,SETH,Mmm. It's good. Barely a scent.
16430,Superbad,SETH,See that? I always said I had the highest alcohol tolerance. I'm like Superman.
16431,Superbad,EVAN,It's fucking water!
16432,Superbad,SETH,Water? Fuck. Your brother beat us to the punch. We have to go back!
16433,Superbad,EVAN,"We can't go back! She totally knew, she'll bust us for sure, and we have to meet Fogell."
16434,Superbad,SETH,"Well, fuck...fine. Text your brother he's a stupid piece of crap."
16435,Superbad,SETH,What the hell is that?
16436,Superbad,FOGELL,A vest.
16437,Superbad,SETH,You're gonna look like a Pinocchio.
16438,Superbad,EVAN,What? It's just a vest.
16439,Superbad,FOGELL,Yeah. How many high schoolers you see in vests?
16440,Superbad,SETH,"You know, they got a ton of liquor right in there. If we get it now we can get to the party faster with all of Jules' shit."
16441,Superbad,FOGELL,No way! I work there. They know I'm not twenty-five.
16442,Superbad,SETH,"Nobody said anything about you, dick- mouth. You have one name on your ID. It's out of the equation!"
16443,Superbad,SETH,And now I'm gonna have to take drastic measures. I'm gonna steal the booze.
16444,Superbad,FOGELL,What?! No! Hell no! You can't do that!
16445,Superbad,EVAN,"Yeah, right!"
16446,Superbad,SETH,"That's right. And that way I give Jules back her money, like you did with Helen. That was good thinking, that's fucking pimp. That's how you seal a deal. It won't be hard. Remember Dan Vertlieb stole a keg from here and he's got, like, really bad scoliosis!"
16447,Superbad,EVAN,"You're not gonna steal it. Fogell, he's not going to steal it."
16448,Superbad,FOGELL,Please. Don't do this! I promise. I'll get the liquor later.
16449,Superbad,SETH,"I'm stepping up. And once I'm up, I don't step back down. Maybe you ""State"" boys don't understand that."
16450,Superbad,SETH,Hope piggy can run.
16451,Superbad,SETH,Twenty two.
16452,Superbad,SETH,Thank you kindly.
16453,Superbad,SETH,"Excuse me, ma'am. You dropped your purse. Would you like me to help you to your car?"
16454,Superbad,SETH,That would be lovely!
16455,Superbad,SETH,Enjoy your remaining years!
16456,Superbad,SETH,I never had a choice.
16457,Superbad,FOGELL,"Oh, and, uh, my Mom said we can have the TV from her basement and I've got, like, three lava-lamps and one strobe light, so like, we can have that in the room-"
16458,Superbad,EVAN,Shh. Seth's coming.
16459,Superbad,FOGELL,You still didn't tell him we're rooming-
16460,Superbad,EVAN,No. Shut up.
16461,Superbad,FOGELL,"So, where's all the stolen liquor?"
16462,Superbad,SETH,"Fuck you! I was gonna do it, but security was tight as shit. I was gonna do it though, don't think I wasn't. Let's go to the liquor store and try your stupid ID."
16463,Superbad,FOGELL,Wait! I'm gonna put my vest back in my locker!
16464,Superbad,EVAN,"Well, here we are. Fogell, are you ready?"
16465,Superbad,SETH,Here's the list.
16466,Superbad,FOGELL,A list? Why?
16467,Superbad,SETH,"We're getting girls their booze so they'll get with us. I put a lot of thought into that list. It's the perfect party bar, so don't mess it up and get Sambuca again."
16468,Superbad,FOGELL,"Ouzo, Drambuie, Jager, Gold-shlay-ger-"
16469,Superbad,EVAN,"Goldschlager. That's for Helen, so do not forget it."
16470,Superbad,FOGELL,"-Alize, Captain Morgan Rum, Smirnoff Rasberry and a big ass bottle of Popov-"
16471,Superbad,SETH,"Oh yeah, and Mike's Hard Lemonade."
16472,Superbad,FOGELL,This is too much. I can't get away with this much!
16473,Superbad,EVAN,What's the difference?
16474,Superbad,FOGELL,"I don't know, man. I'm getting, like, really nervous."
16475,Superbad,EVAN,Are you okay?
16476,Superbad,SETH,What the hell are you doing?
16477,Superbad,FOGELL,I don't know if I want to do this.
16478,Superbad,SETH,What are you talking about? You just promised you would. What is this shit?
16479,Superbad,FOGELL,What if they turn me down?
16480,Superbad,SETH,Then we're in the same place that we're in right now!
16481,Superbad,FOGELL,It's fucking humiliating! Everyone in the store sees them kicking me out. What if they make me put all the liquor back on the shelf? I can't do that!
16482,Superbad,SETH,"This whole thing is bigger than you, asshead! Just go in there and buy the damn alcohol!"
16483,Superbad,FOGELL,What if I don't feel like it anymore?
16484,Superbad,SETH,"Then I will kill you! How's that? If you don't buy the alcohol, I will kill you!"
16485,Superbad,FOGELL,"Killing me won't get you any alcohol, jerkoff! I'm the one with the ID!"
16486,Superbad,SETH,"Then I will kill you, cut off your ugly face, put it over mine, and buy it my fucking self."
16487,Superbad,FOGELL,You don't have the technology or the steady hands to pull off a procedure like that!
16488,Superbad,EVAN,"Seth, calm down! Fogell, stop being a baby and go buy the alcohol! You said you'd do it, so do it. It's why you bought the ID, so just go do it."
16489,Superbad,FOGELL,I'll try.
16490,Superbad,FOGELL,No.
16491,Superbad,FOGELL,"Uh...nothing. Not Fogell... Shut up, Moscovitch. You don't know me."
16492,Superbad,FOGELL,Fuck.
16493,Superbad,FOGELL,"Umm, nope, no problem whatsoever."
16494,Superbad,FOGELL,No. I think it happened before.
16495,Superbad,FOGELL,"I think I would know, thank you."
16496,Superbad,SETH,"It's a good ID, right? Mike Snider never had a problem. It's fine. Right?"
16497,Superbad,EVAN,Calm down. Did you remember a condom?
16498,Superbad,SETH,You brought a condom?
16499,Superbad,EVAN,"Yeah, I figured, you know, might as well. I brought one of those little things of spermicidal lube too."
16500,Superbad,SETH,You asshole! You laughed in my face when I said we'd be having sex tonight.
16501,Superbad,EVAN,It doesn't mean you shouldn't be prepared. You didn't even bring one?
16502,Superbad,SETH,No. That wasn't the plan! We had a plan! I can't believe you did that without even consulting me about it!
16503,Superbad,EVAN,I don't really even understand what your plan is.
16504,Superbad,SETH,"I'm gonna go down on her for, like, hours. She'll love that. She'll want to go out with that."
16505,Superbad,EVAN,"Yeah, but I figured there's no harm in bringing just one little condom."
16506,Superbad,SETH,"And one little bottle of spermicidal lube. That's nuts. You can't let her know you brought that! These girls are 18, not dried up old ladies. They're ready to go."
16507,Superbad,EVAN,Fine. I won't bring the lube.
16508,Superbad,FOGELL,Hello... Mindy.
16509,Superbad,FOGELL,"Oh, I love that stuff. Been drinking it for years. I heard they recently decided to start adding more hops."
16510,Superbad,FOGELL,Identification?
16511,Superbad,EVAN,Do you think I could get Helen to do some kind of long distance thing?
16512,Superbad,SETH,Holy Shit! It's Cary Hutchins!
16513,Superbad,EVAN,I haven't seen her since she switched schools.
16514,Superbad,SETH,She had the biggest tits in the universe.
16515,Superbad,EVAN,I heard she had breast-reduction surgery. Her tits must be crazy perfect now.
16516,Superbad,SETH,I gotta see these bastards. Let's check `em out.
16517,Superbad,SETH,"Man, I'm gonna pretend to trip and grab `em. I hope they've healed."
16518,Superbad,FOGELL,What the hell happened?!
16519,Superbad,EVAN,That was a waste.
16520,Superbad,SETH,"But she fully looked way better before. I thought when they reduced them, they just kind of reshaped them nicer. Made them more supple."
16521,Superbad,EVAN,I can't even begin to imagine the justification for making breasts smaller.
16522,Superbad,SETH,It's like me making my nuts saggier.
16523,Superbad,EVAN,Whoa. What's this?
16524,Superbad,SETH,What?
16525,Superbad,EVAN,Check it out! The cops!
16526,Superbad,EVAN,Shit! They busted Fogell!
16527,Superbad,FOGELL,"My name, it's...it's.. Mc..mac..laddle..."
16528,Superbad,FOGELL,"No, no I said, ""McLovin""."
16529,Superbad,FOGELL,McLovin.
16530,Superbad,FOGELL,Oh...that's uh...a good one...it's a...an interesting...uh...event...
16531,Superbad,SETH,I don't believe this bullshit! I can't...this isn't happening! I didn't even know you could get arrested for this shit! WE NEED THAT FUCKING LIQUOR!
16532,Superbad,EVAN,Oh my god. Are they gonna take him downtown?
16533,Superbad,SETH,Fuck Fogell! He got arrested! We're on our own.
16534,Superbad,SETH,We need a new way of getting liquor. AAAHHH!! The money! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! How much money can you get?
16535,Superbad,EVAN,What are you talking about? Money? What about Fogell?
16536,Superbad,SETH,That doesn't matter anymore. I just lost a hundred dollars of Jules' money!
16537,Superbad,EVAN,We have to help him!
16538,Superbad,SETH,"Help him? What are we gonna do? Bust him out of jail? I don't even know where jail is! What we need is the alcohol, which is impossible because we don't have any fucking money!"
16539,Superbad,EVAN,Fine. Just...calm down. We need to think. We need to think.
16540,Superbad,SETH,Fuck thinking! We need to act!
16541,Superbad,FOGELL,It's just... I changed my name. I was going to be a singer. R&B.
16542,Superbad,FOGELL,Old enough.
16543,Superbad,FOGELL,Um...okay...
16544,Superbad,FOGELL,What?
16545,Superbad,FOGELL,"Look. I'm really sorry, but I don't really have any information. I didn't really see him. His fist hit here."
16546,Superbad,FOGELL,"Uh, yeah... kinda. I kinda had to catch a bus."
16547,Superbad,FOGELL,Umm... near thirteenth and Granville.
16548,Superbad,SETH,Why wouldn't I report you?
16549,Superbad,SETH,You have any money?
16550,Superbad,EVAN,What are you doing?
16551,Superbad,SETH,What is this? This isn't enough.
16552,Superbad,SETH,"Well, you just came from the liquor store, give us your liquor."
16553,Superbad,SETH,"Well, they'll be arresting somebody else if you don't do something quick. Ow! My shoulder! It's killing me."
16554,Superbad,SETH,You better.
16555,Superbad,EVAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Come here."
16556,Superbad,EVAN,What are you doing?
16557,Superbad,SETH,"What? Jules' money is gone, Fogell's out, we've got no other option. Let's go."
16558,Superbad,EVAN,I don't....I don't like this idea at all. I'm just not feeling it. That guy's fucking creepy. Just look at him.
16559,Superbad,SETH,"He's an idiot. And he's our only hope. Come on, don't break your promise to Helen."
16560,Superbad,FOGELL,Heh. Good one.
16561,Superbad,SETH,Aaah!
16562,Superbad,SETH,875-6611? Holy shit...
16563,Superbad,SETH,Jules! What's the haps?
16564,Superbad,SETH,Jules! I just got in a cab and I'm going to the liquor store as we speak.
16565,Superbad,SETH,Really?
16566,Superbad,SETH,"Well, if they want to do that they're going to have to get through me."
16567,Superbad,SETH,"She called, man! That's insane! She's practically begging for it. She said, ""I can't wait for you to get here."""
16568,Superbad,EVAN,"Hey, are you sure that it's cool we're here?"
16569,Superbad,EVAN,This is weird.
16570,Superbad,SETH,Whatever. Just act casual. And old. All we gotta do is find the booze and haul ass out of here.
16571,Superbad,SETH,Holy shit! Let's grab one of these buckets and go.
16572,Superbad,EVAN,"Dude, let's slip out the back."
16573,Superbad,SETH,"Why? Come on, we're here. Let's just hurry up and do this."
16574,Superbad,EVAN,"You want to end up like that guy? Not me, I need my nuts."
16575,Superbad,SETH,We need this liquor!
16576,Superbad,EVAN,"You need it! I don't need it. I'm going to tell Helen I like her, and then maybe she'll get with me; not after I get her stinking drunk."
16577,Superbad,SETH,"Then why haven't you ever made a move, you pussy?"
16578,Superbad,EVAN,Because I respect her! I'm not going to put that kind of unfair pressure on her.
16579,Superbad,SETH,"These aren't girls, they're women! They need our dicks as much as we need their poons - and we all love liquor, so where's the fucking beef?!"
16580,Superbad,EVAN,"We're leaving, okay? These guys could kill us. You want to get killed for liquor?"
16581,Superbad,SETH,You're really gonna bail on me?!
16582,Superbad,EVAN,Jesus...
16583,Superbad,SETH,"Okay, okay...if that's how you're going to be, then I'll get the booze on my own. And you're not getting any. And neither is Helen!"
16584,Superbad,FOGELL,"Um...hey...uh, officers. I could answer those, uh, questions now if you want."
16585,Superbad,FOGELL,It was only one guy.
16586,Superbad,FOGELL,Aren't you guys supposed to be trained or something? Don't you have a computer?
16587,Superbad,FOGELL,Who's Bob?
16588,Superbad,FOGELL,Um...okay...
16589,Superbad,EVAN,Whaa! What the...oh..
16590,Superbad,EVAN,Oh dude. Oh dude. Oh dude.
16591,Superbad,EVAN,Okay. Okay. Here we go...
16592,Superbad,EVAN,Helen? Helen?!?
16593,Superbad,FOGELL,Well...what's goin' on in there?
16594,Superbad,FOGELL,AHHH!!!
16595,Superbad,FOGELL,"Ow!!! Please! Stop, you fucking bum!!!"
16596,Superbad,SETH,"Hey, wut up?"
16597,Superbad,SETH,Uh...no. What? I don't know what you're talking about.
16598,Superbad,SETH,I didn't spill anything on myself.
16599,Superbad,SETH,Oh shit.
16600,Superbad,SETH,What the hell is this?
16601,Superbad,SETH,"Yeah, so?"
16602,Superbad,SETH,Why would I get blood on my leg from--- OH SHIT!
16603,Superbad,SETH,Some girl perioded on my fucking leg!
16604,Superbad,SETH,That is disgusting.
16605,Superbad,SETH,Who's Bill? Don't show Bill! No! I can't believe this is happening!
16606,Superbad,SETH,This is un-fucking-believable. I have to look good tonight!
16607,Superbad,SETH,Who gives a shit? Fuck! These aren't even my pants!
16608,Superbad,SETH,"Yeah. It's really funny, huh? Yuk it up, assholes."
16609,Superbad,SETH,I gotta clean this shit.
16610,Superbad,FOGELL,You've been in shoot-outs!
16611,Superbad,FOGELL,"Hey, you don't need to tell me."
16612,Superbad,FOGELL,I don't know. I find they're always good for a little quick ass.
16613,Superbad,FOGELL,"Well, officers, it's not the going with the ladies I care about, it's the coming."
16614,Superbad,FOGELL,"So...you guys got guns, huh?"
16615,Superbad,FOGELL,Can I...can I hold one? Your gun?
16616,Superbad,FOGELL,Wow. I've never held one. Are they hard to shoot?
16617,Superbad,FOGELL,"You guys are going to shoot something, right?"
16618,Superbad,SETH,Jesus's tits!
16619,Superbad,EVAN,Hey! Helen. Hi. I had bad reception. Are you at the party?
16620,Superbad,EVAN,"Yeah, definitely. Um, about your Goldschlager..."
16621,Superbad,EVAN,What's going on there?
16622,Superbad,EVAN,Nope. I'm gonna be there.
16623,Superbad,EVAN,I think it's going to be a real fun...event.
16624,Superbad,EVAN,No. What splotch-
16625,Superbad,EVAN,"Oh no, that's not me either. Wrong guy, man. Sorry."
16626,Superbad,EVAN,"Trust me, man. That wasn't me. I don't even listen to rap."
16627,Superbad,SETH,I did it man. Peace out-tro.
16628,Superbad,SETH,"Hey! You got one, too! We're blood brothers."
16629,Superbad,SETH,I...I didn't dance with her! I don't even dance! Never even tried it!
16630,Superbad,SETH,I don't know. Maybe me and you rubbed up against each other at some point. How am I supposed to know?
16631,Superbad,EVAN,"...cause, yo! Bitches and gats, bitches and gats, what do all of we's got?"
16632,Superbad,EVAN,When we steal all the money?
16633,Superbad,EVAN,Yo! I kill the whores of Vice City with my magnum 9/Take out the punk pigs with my Glok design/ Drink a fifth of Hennessy and get benign/Fuck all the bitches with their asses fine
16634,Superbad,SETH,I swear to God it wasn't me!
16635,Superbad,SETH,It's nothing. It's detergent.
16636,Superbad,SETH,"I...uh, I got blood on my pants."
16637,Superbad,SETH,I brought them from home.
16638,Superbad,EVAN,What?
16639,Superbad,SETH,AHH!!!
16640,Superbad,SETH,You're the one who used my leg as a tampon!
16641,Superbad,FOGELL,"You can do it, officer."
16642,Superbad,FOGELL,Yeah! And eat his ass!
16643,Superbad,FOGELL,Can I shoot one?
16644,Superbad,FOGELL,What does that mean? We gonna get to shoot anyone?
16645,Superbad,FOGELL,"Yeah, man. Let's show these fuckers how we roll."
16646,Superbad,SETH,...huff...hufff...you fuckin' prick...
16647,Superbad,EVAN,What?
16648,Superbad,SETH,You...huff...bailed on me...huff...man.
16649,Superbad,EVAN,No I didn't!
16650,Superbad,SETH,Of course you did! We were supposed to do something and you left instead of doing it! That's the definition of bailing!
16651,Superbad,EVAN,"If you said we should burn our dicks off and I didn't, that's not bailing!"
16652,Superbad,SETH,"It is bailing, if you promised to burn your dick off!"
16653,Superbad,EVAN,What?!
16654,Superbad,SETH,"The bottom line is you're a bailer. You just bailed on me, you bailed on me this morning when Terry spat on me, and you're bailing on me next year!"
16655,Superbad,EVAN,Oh! Okay! There it is! It finally comes out!
16656,Superbad,SETH,We were supposed to go to college together! Since elementary school! What ever happened to that!
16657,Superbad,EVAN,"What happened to that, is that you're too stupid to get into the schools I did!"
16658,Superbad,SETH,"I was not too stupid, I was too lazy!"
16659,Superbad,EVAN,"You've wasted all my time, you selfish bastard!!! Instead of chasing girls and making friends, I threw away the last three years talking bullshit with you! And now, because of you, I'm going to college a fucking friendless virgin!"
16660,Superbad,SETH,Getting with a girl won't make you any less of a loser next year!
16661,Superbad,EVAN,You talking to me or yourself? You fucking loser!
16662,Superbad,FOGELL,"So, like, what does that computer do?"
16663,Superbad,FOGELL,Um...my French teacher. Mrs. Graham. Susette Graham.
16664,Superbad,FOGELL,What did you do?
16665,Superbad,FOGELL,"I hate my dad, too!"
16666,Superbad,FOGELL,It's too dark out.
16667,Superbad,FOGELL,Oh my god...is he...are you gonna make sure he's alright?
16668,Superbad,EVAN,I'm sorry! You pushed me first.
16669,Superbad,SETH,I didn't push you into fucking oncoming traffic!
16670,Superbad,SETH,We're great.
16671,Superbad,SETH,"What, when cops drive like maniacs and hop the fucking curb?"
16672,Superbad,EVAN,Nothing.
16673,Superbad,EVAN,No officer. Not at all.
16674,Superbad,SETH,"Umm, no sir, detergent."
16675,Superbad,SETH,My clothes are dirty.
16676,Superbad,EVAN,Puh...please don't shoot.
16677,Superbad,FOGELL,Was the guy alright?
16678,Superbad,FOGELL,"Umm, yeah, sure. You guys are great."
16679,Superbad,FOGELL,Sure.
16680,Superbad,EVAN,"Uh...I don't know, five-foot-ten, eleven?"
16681,Superbad,FOGELL,Seth! Wait up!
16682,Superbad,FOGELL,Holy shit! Little kids!!!
16683,Superbad,SETH,Ow!
16684,Superbad,FOGELL,Help!
16685,Superbad,FOGELL,Aaaahhh!!!!
16686,Superbad,SETH,ARGGG!
16687,Superbad,EVAN,Oh god. Oh god. Fuck. Fuck.
16688,Superbad,EVAN,Should I run!?!
16689,Superbad,SETH,Fucking run!
16690,Superbad,SETH,No! Fuck off! You already drank our detergent beer!
16691,Superbad,SETH,"Back off, or we'll kick the shit out of you!"
16692,Superbad,EVAN,We can't do that. He's homeless.
16693,Superbad,SETH,So? Who cares? Just because he doesn't have a home doesn't mean he can be a lunatic!
16694,Superbad,EVAN,GOOOOOOOLDSCHLLLAAAAAAAGERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!
16695,Superbad,FOGELL,What the hell is going on? Where did you come from?
16696,Superbad,FOGELL,Holy shit! We're like three blocks away! Best luck ever!
16697,Superbad,FOGELL,"Fuck yeah, guys. We made it. Together and safe."
16698,Superbad,EVAN,I can't believe Helen's bottle broke.
16699,Superbad,FOGELL,I'm sure it'll be fine.
16700,Superbad,SETH,"What's the difference? I thought you didn't need it anyways. I thought you were just going to tell her how you feel, you fucking pussy."
16701,Superbad,EVAN,"Yeah? Well, good luck getting Jule's drunk enough to have sex with you."
16702,Superbad,FOGELL,What's wrong with you guys?
16703,Superbad,SETH,"Shut up, Fogell. Never mind. Evan'll tell you next year."
16704,Superbad,FOGELL,You told him?
16705,Superbad,SETH,Told me what?
16706,Superbad,FOGELL,Well we have to tell him now.
16707,Superbad,EVAN,"Fuck, Fogell! You're a god damn idiot."
16708,Superbad,FOGELL,"Well, he knows something's up."
16709,Superbad,SETH,Just say it!
16710,Superbad,EVAN,"Shit. Seth, me and Fogell are rooming together next year."
16711,Superbad,FOGELL,"I don't even get what the big deal is, to be honest."
16712,Superbad,EVAN,I didn't tell you because-
16713,Superbad,SETH,Save that shit for later. We've got shit to do.
16714,Superbad,FOGELL,We never should have had to hide our arrangement.
16715,Superbad,SETH,The bar is open!
16716,Superbad,SETH,Sorry it was late.
16717,Superbad,SETH,I'll be right here.
16718,Superbad,SETH,To Jules!
16719,Superbad,SETH,Seth!
16720,Superbad,SETH,Hey! Let's do another one to me!
16721,Superbad,EVAN,Becca! Hey.
16722,Superbad,EVAN,What?
16723,Superbad,EVAN,What? What did she say? Does she think I'm a good guy? What did she say?
16724,Superbad,EVAN,What?!?
16725,Superbad,EVAN,Oh man. This is too much. Oh god. What do I do? I lost the Goldschlager I was supposed to bring her!
16726,Superbad,EVAN,"What? Oh man... But...she's totally hammered. If I get with her, and I'm not drunk, isn't that, like, date rape?"
16727,Superbad,EVAN,I guess.
16728,Superbad,EVAN,"Calm down, Evan. She likes you. She wants to suck on your penis. That's a good thing."
16729,Superbad,EVAN,Down the hatch.
16730,Superbad,FOGELL,"They call you Nicola, right?"
16731,Superbad,FOGELL,Some do.
16732,Superbad,EVAN,"Hey, Helen. Sorry I was-"
16733,Superbad,EVAN,Uh...well...uh...
16734,Superbad,EVAN,"Oh man, it's a crazy story-"
16735,Superbad,EVAN,I'm already pretty wasted. But...uh...here's to you.
16736,Superbad,EVAN,Uh...uh...uh...you could just tell me right here-
16737,Superbad,FOGELL,"Yeah, I just thought it sounded old."
16738,Superbad,SETH,Jules! The hostess with the most-est! The woman of the hour!
16739,Superbad,SETH,This party's blowin' my ass off! I want you to have a drink with me.
16740,Superbad,SETH,"It's just how I roll, Jules. No problems, no problems."
16741,Superbad,SETH,"Uh...you know...I love talking, and conversing with you, you're so good at it, but I can't hear you. Could we just go on the...uh...balcony or something?"
16742,Superbad,EVAN,Are you okay?
16743,Superbad,EVAN,"Oh man. Helen...I want to tell you, I mean, I've wanted to tell you, for a long time-"
16744,Superbad,EVAN,"Shit. Can you, like, slip out?"
16745,Superbad,EVAN,Whoa. Fuckin'...careful.
16746,Superbad,FOGELL,Why?
16747,Superbad,FOGELL,"Well, you're about to learn a few things."
16748,Superbad,SETH,What? What's wrong?
16749,Superbad,SETH,But...there is no other time. School's up! This is the only time...what's wrong with now?
16750,Superbad,SETH,So? So are you.
16751,Superbad,SETH,"You don't drink? But...but, you told me to get the liquor!"
16752,Superbad,SETH,You don't drink!?!
16753,Superbad,SETH,"And you, don't want to...uh, you know..."
16754,Superbad,SETH,Ahhh....man...fuck....
16755,Superbad,SETH,"No! Yeah, so what if I am? I'm a fucking idiot and it was my last chance! So I should be crying."
16756,Superbad,SETH,"To make you my girlfriend for the summer, okay? There! You're, like, the coolest person that's ever talked to me, and I thought we'd both be drunk, but..."
16757,Superbad,SETH,`Cause you'd never get with me in your right mind! Look at me! And now look at you!
16758,Superbad,EVAN,You're so beautiful.
16759,Superbad,EVAN,Um...thank you. I've thought you were a really incredible person for a really long time.
16760,Superbad,EVAN,I'm...I'm..I'm about to. But first I just want to tell you exactly how I-
16761,Superbad,EVAN,"You don't have to do that, you know, we can start this relationship on something more than just that."
16762,Superbad,EVAN,Jesus Christ.
16763,Superbad,EVAN,You don't want to do this.
16764,Superbad,EVAN,"Look, you know I really like you, Helen, but this is...it's just too intense. And I'm so drunk I don't even know how to, like, process-"
16765,Superbad,EVAN,What? Did you just call me a...pussy?
16766,Superbad,EVAN,Oh god! Oh...
16767,Superbad,EVAN,I'll...uh...I'll go get her. Are you going to be okay?
16768,Superbad,FOGELL,I've got a boner.
16769,Superbad,FOGELL,And lube.
16770,Superbad,SETH,...help me...
16771,Superbad,SETH,...sorry...
16772,Superbad,SETH,Oh no.
16773,Superbad,SETH,...Evan...
16774,Superbad,EVAN,"Life's bullshit, huh, Miroki?"
16775,Superbad,EVAN,"Fuckin' wax off, asshole!"
16776,Superbad,SETH,"No...I'm helping you, man! Just listen..."
16777,Superbad,EVAN,"Fuck off, jerk! You're hurting my shoulders!"
16778,Superbad,EVAN,Dude! Seth! It's the cops! The cops.
16779,Superbad,SETH,That's what I've been...! Here...
16780,Superbad,FOGELL,It's...it's in. It's in.
16781,Superbad,FOGELL,What the hell?
16782,Superbad,FOGELL,Officer Slater?
16783,Superbad,FOGELL,"No! I hit my head when we crashed. I was all disoriented and I just wandered off, confused. Seriously!"
16784,Superbad,FOGELL,What? No! No!
16785,Superbad,FOGELL,I didn't break the law! I'm not really even-
16786,Superbad,EVAN,Dude. You saved me!
16787,Superbad,SETH,I totally did! I wanted to!
16788,Superbad,EVAN,"Wanna sleep at my house, man? You're my best friend!"
16789,Superbad,SETH,Yeah! Sleepover! Fuckin...you got pizza bagels still?
16790,Superbad,EVAN,Yeah!!!! Look what else I gots!
16791,Superbad,SETH,Nice!
16792,Superbad,FOGELL,So...am I going to jail?
16793,Superbad,FOGELL,What?
16794,Superbad,FOGELL,I don't understand!
16795,Superbad,FOGELL,Seventeen.
16796,Superbad,EVAN,Is the bang bus anything like this?
16797,Superbad,FOGELL,"So, like, what's your official position?"
16798,Superbad,FOGELL,Of course. That mugger had nothing but murder in his eyes. I owe you my life.
16799,Superbad,FOGELL,Can I get a shot?
16800,Superbad,SETH,I can't believe she said that shit.
16801,Superbad,EVAN,Oh my lord. You have no idea!
16802,Superbad,EVAN,"And then you saved me, man! I fucking love you!"
16803,Superbad,SETH,"I fucking love you, too, man! I'm not embarrassed, I just love you!"
16804,Superbad,EVAN,"Why don't we say that more? It feels good! I love you more than my brother, man. Like, when you went away for Easter last year, I, like, missed you. You know?"
16805,Superbad,SETH,"I missed you, too. Come here, man."
16806,Superbad,SETH,We'll always be friends. `Cause we love each other.
16807,Superbad,SETH,"Like, three weeks ago I was in you room and, like, you were taking a dump and...I saw your residence placement thingy. I totally saw you're living with Fogell. So, like-"
16808,Superbad,EVAN,"I'm sorry, man."
16809,Superbad,SETH,Don't be! Don't be! I'm sorry. I was being a bitch.
16810,Superbad,EVAN,I need you to know that it's not like I even want to live with Fogell; it's just that I'm really afraid of living with strangers.
16811,Superbad,SETH,"You know...I was pissed off I didn't get with Jules, but, like...we really got through a lot of our shit, you know?"
16812,Superbad,EVAN,"Yeah, me too. Like, yeah...at least we kind of came together, again."
16813,Superbad,EVAN,"Good night, Seth. I love you."
16814,Superbad,SETH,"Night, Evan. Love you, man."
16815,Superbad,EVAN,Oh...uh...hey. Morning.
16816,Superbad,SETH,Uh...morning.
16817,Superbad,EVAN,You sleep good?
16818,Superbad,SETH,Yeah. This is a really good pillow.
16819,Superbad,EVAN,Um...
16820,Superbad,SETH,Maybe I should get going.
16821,Superbad,EVAN,"You don't have to. I'm not, like, doing anything."
16822,Superbad,SETH,"Oh...do you want to hang out? I was...gonna go to the mall, actually."
16823,Superbad,EVAN,"Oh. Cool, well, can I come? I need a comforter. For college."
16824,Superbad,SETH,Yeah. That'd be nice. I'd really like that.
16825,Superbad,EVAN,Don't ask me. I don't give a shit if your pants look good.
16826,Superbad,SETH,"Well, I need someone's opinion."
16827,Superbad,EVAN,Fine. They're way too small.
16828,Superbad,SETH,"Yeah, but when I was wearing your dad's pants last night I realized that if I buy pants that are too small it'll encourage me to lose weight. And in tight pants chicks'll kind of see my dick a little."
16829,Superbad,EVAN,"Yeah, the male camel toe look is really big this year."
16830,Superbad,SETH,These pants suck. Let's the get the fuck out of here.
16831,Superbad,EVAN,Holy shit!
16832,Superbad,SETH,Is that them?
16833,Superbad,EVAN,Should we hide?
16834,Superbad,SETH,"Fuck that, man. I can't talk to her, look what I did to her!"
16835,Superbad,EVAN,Helen called me a pussy to my face! What am I going to say to her?
16836,Superbad,SETH,"Oh my god. I'm so sorry, Jules."
16837,Superbad,EVAN,How are you feeling?
16838,Superbad,SETH,"That looks terrible. No! I mean, it doesn't look terrible, it looks-"
16839,Superbad,EVAN,Did you have fun last night?
16840,Superbad,SETH,"Not really. I remember looking up, and you screaming at me. That's about it."
16841,Superbad,EVAN,"No, I dodged it. Whizzed right by me."
16842,Superbad,SETH,"But seriously, I acted like a fuckin' idiot last night. I'm really sorry, you didn't deserve that."
16843,Superbad,SETH,You look good with a black eye.
16844,Superbad,SETH,Oh man...
16845,Superbad,EVAN,"Oh! I have to get a comforter too, for college."
16846,Superbad,SETH,"Yes! Definitely. I'd love to. I had such bad acne last year, I became an expert on the stuff."
16847,Superbad,EVAN,You could get your college pants there.
16848,Superbad,SETH,"Yeah, but wait...you drove me here, Evan drove me here, how do we-"
16849,Superbad,EVAN,Maybe we can go eat after?
16850,Superbad,SETH,"So, uh, I'll call you later."
16851,Superbad,EVAN,"Yeah man, have a good one."
16852,Thor,JANE,"Hurry! We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below. Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG who emerges as well, rubbing his head."
16853,Thor,JANE,Oh-- watch your head.
16854,Thor,JANE,"It's a little different each time. Once it looked like, I don't know, melted stars, pooling in a corner of the sky. But last week it was a rolling rainbow ribbon--"
16855,Thor,JANE,"Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and my gloves, will you? Intern DARCY LEWIS hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin."
16856,Thor,JANE,Not until you see it!
16857,Thor,JANE,Thank you.
16858,Thor,JANE,The benefit of the doubt. The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.
16859,Thor,JANE,It's never taken this long before. Darcy calls up from the front seat.
16860,Thor,JANE,"Sure, if you like rocking out to KFRM, ""All agriculture, all the time."" Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle."
16861,Thor,JANE,"The anomalies are always precipitated by geomagnetic storms. She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book, tracking occurrences and patterns."
16862,Thor,JANE,"The last seventeen occurrences have been predictable to the minute... I just don't understand. Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror. She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert."
16863,Thor,JANE,There's got to be some new variable... Or an equipment malfunction... The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.
16864,Thor,JANE,What?!
16865,Thor,JANE,Holy. Shatner.
16866,Thor,JANE,No-- yes! Let's go!
16867,Thor,JANE,Isn't this great?! A thought strikes her.
16868,Thor,JANE,"You're seeing it too, right? I'm not crazy?"
16869,Thor,JANE,You've gotta get us closer so I can take a magnetic reading. Darcy laughs.
16870,Thor,JANE,You want those college credits or not?
16871,Thor,JANE,What are you doing?!
16872,Thor,JANE,"Get the first aid kit. Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively. She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome, long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing the life back into him."
16873,Thor,JANE,"Come on, big guy. Do me a favor and don't be dead, okay? Open your eyes and look at me. Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as his eyes flutter open. She looks deep into his confused, azure eyes, which at last focus on her own. Locking onto them. For a moment, they each forget to breathe. The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is."
16874,Thor,JANE,--are dilating. That's a good sign.
16875,Thor,JANE,"Where did he come from? They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last glowing remnants of the storm, and into:"
16876,Thor,THOR,Another!
16877,Thor,THOR,Have you ever known me to be nervous?
16878,Thor,LOKI,There was the time in Nornheim...
16879,Thor,THOR,"That wasn't nerves, brother. It was the rage of battle. How else could I have fought my way through a hundred warriors and pulled us out alive? The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for Thor."
16880,Thor,LOKI,"As I recall, I was the one who veiled us in smoke to ease our escape."
16881,Thor,THOR,"Some do battle, others just do tricks. The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand. EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles."
16882,Thor,THOR,"Loki... Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered."
16883,Thor,THOR,Now that was just a waste of good wine.
16884,Thor,LOKI,"Just a bit of fun. Right, my friend? The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGED"
16885,Thor,LOKI,Nice feathers.
16886,Thor,THOR,"You don't really want to start this again, do you, Cow?"
16887,Thor,LOKI,I was being sincere!
16888,Thor,THOR,You're incapable of sincerity.
16889,Thor,LOKI,"Am I? He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost."
16890,Thor,LOKI,"I've looked forward to this day as long as you have. You're my brother and my friend. Sometimes I'm envious, but never doubt that I love you."
16891,Thor,THOR,"Thank you. The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:"
16892,Thor,LOKI,Give us a kiss.
16893,Thor,THOR,Stop. Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.
16894,Thor,THOR,How do I look?
16895,Thor,LOKI,Like a king. They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.
16896,Thor,LOKI,It's time.
16897,Thor,THOR,You go ahead. Loki casts him a wary look.
16898,Thor,THOR,I'll be along. Go on. Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.
16899,Thor,THOR,Why does everyone keep saying that? I'm not nervous!
16900,Thor,THOR,...but never you. I know.
16901,Thor,THOR,And what is that?
16902,Thor,LOKI,"He said he'd be along. Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval."
16903,Thor,LOKI,I wouldn't worry. Father will forgive him. He always does.
16904,Thor,THOR,I swear.
16905,Thor,THOR,I swear.
16906,Thor,THOR,I swear.
16907,Thor,THOR,The Jotuns must pay for what they've done!
16908,Thor,THOR,"""All is well?!"" They broke into the Weapons Vault! If the Frost Giants had stolen even one of these"
16909,Thor,THOR,I want to know why they--
16910,Thor,THOR,And if you hadn't taken it from them they would have laid waste to all the Nine Realms!
16911,Thor,THOR,He just broke your truce! We must act! Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three.
16912,Thor,THOR,"March into Jotunheim as you once did, teach them a lesson, break their spirits so they'll never dare try to cross our borders again!"
16913,Thor,THOR,This was an act of war!
16914,Thor,THOR,They got this far!
16915,Thor,THOR,"As King of Asgard, I would--"
16916,Thor,THOR,"It's unwise to be in my company right now, brother."
16917,Thor,LOKI,Who said I was wise?
16918,Thor,THOR,This was to be my day of triumph.
16919,Thor,LOKI,It will come. In time.
16920,Thor,THOR,"Yes, exactly!"
16921,Thor,LOKI,"But there's nothing we can do without defying Father. Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye. Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned."
16922,Thor,LOKI,No... stop there! I know that look!
16923,Thor,THOR,It's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders.
16924,Thor,LOKI,It's madness!
16925,Thor,LOKI,Nothing! Thor was making a jest!
16926,Thor,THOR,The safety of our Realm is no jest. We're going to Jotunheim.
16927,Thor,THOR,"My father fought his way into Jotunheim, defeated their armies, and took their Casket! We'd just be looking for answers."
16928,Thor,THOR,"My friends, have you forgotten all that we've done together? He turns to Fandral."
16929,Thor,THOR,Who brought you into the sweet embrace of the most exotic maidens in all of Yggdrasil?
16930,Thor,THOR,And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this Realm has ever known?
16931,Thor,THOR,"Come on. You're not going to let my brother and me take all the glory, are you? Loki looks startled."
16932,Thor,LOKI,What?
16933,Thor,THOR,You are coming with me...
16934,Thor,LOKI,"Yes, of course! I won't let my brother march into Jotunheim alone. I will be at his side."
16935,Thor,THOR,We must first find a way to get past Heimdall.
16936,Thor,LOKI,"Keep your weapons sheathed and your mouths closed. This is going to take subtlety and sincerity, not brute strength. Leave it to me. Loki dismounts and steps forward."
16937,Thor,LOKI,I'm sorry?
16938,Thor,LOKI,You must be mistaken. We're not--
16939,Thor,THOR,"Then tell no one where we've gone until we've returned. Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles him."
16940,Thor,LOKI,Get me off this bridge before it cracks under your girth. Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.
16941,Thor,THOR,I have no plans to die today.
16942,Thor,THOR,"Come on. Don't be bashful. The others join him at his side, then step towards the Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom, changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked off the platform and inside the vortex."
16943,Thor,THOR,"Come on, big fella. Up...! With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:"
16944,Thor,THOR,Too late now.
16945,Thor,LOKI,Perhaps we should wait. Thor turns back to his brother.
16946,Thor,THOR,For what?
16947,Thor,LOKI,To survey the enemy. To gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance.
16948,Thor,THOR,"We know all we must. It's time to act. Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow."
16949,Thor,THOR,"It feels good, doesn't it? To be together again, adventuring on another world?"
16950,Thor,THOR,What would you call it?
16951,Thor,THOR,How about a song to lift our spirits? The others groan.
16952,Thor,THOR,Hiding. As cowards always do. Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza. Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.
16953,Thor,THOR,I speak only to your King. Not to his foot soldiers.
16954,Thor,THOR,And I am--
16955,Thor,THOR,"I demand answers. Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together."
16956,Thor,THOR,How did your people get into Asgard?
16957,Thor,THOR,Do not dishonor my father's name with your lies.
16958,Thor,THOR,"Not when you'd use it to make war against other Realms. Laufey laughs, cold, mocking."
16959,Thor,THOR,"This boy has grown tired of your mockery. Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores him."
16960,Thor,LOKI,"Thor, stop and think. Look around you. We are outnumbered."
16961,Thor,THOR,"Know your place, brother..."
16962,Thor,LOKI,"We will accept your most gracious offer. The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant nearby mutters under his breath."
16963,Thor,LOKI,"Damn. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor. Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them."
16964,Thor,THOR,Next! Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.
16965,Thor,LOKI,"Pathetic. He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at once. Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE. The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back. Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns."
16966,Thor,THOR,"Come on! At least make it a challenge for me! He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor rises, grins."
16967,Thor,THOR,"Now that's more like it! He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute head over heels. Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies back to his grasp."
16968,Thor,THOR,"Ugly and stupid. Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the ground by another. It raises its weapon above her. Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in the chest. The Jotun falls dead."
16969,Thor,THOR,"Come on! But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon. Mjolnir falls to the ground. A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the ground, to no avail. Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to leave. From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the wall of the palace, and down to the ground below. The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their feet."
16970,Thor,LOKI,That can't be good.
16971,Thor,LOKI,"Thor, we must go! Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat of battle."
16972,Thor,THOR,Then go!
16973,Thor,THOR,I can stop them! The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all around them.
16974,Thor,LOKI,"Likely killed us all! As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them. The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not move, for fear of falling through, into the void below. Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his comrades."
16975,Thor,THOR,"Loki, we have to see. Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating. But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too many, even for a Thunder God."
16976,Thor,THOR,Now! We'll finish them together!
16977,Thor,THOR,Why did you bring us back?
16978,Thor,THOR,I was protecting my home.
16979,Thor,THOR,There won't be a kingdom to protect if you're afraid to act! Odin stares at him.
16980,Thor,THOR,"Whatever the cost, the world must know that the new King of Asgard will not be held in contempt."
16981,Thor,THOR,"While you wait and be patient, the Nine Realms laugh at us! The old ways are done. You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls!"
16982,Thor,THOR,"And you are an old man and a fool! The whole world seems to stop at Thor's words. Odin falls quiet. When he speaks again, there's something terrifying beneath the calmness of his words."
16983,Thor,JANE,Get the first aid kit.
16984,Thor,JANE,"Uh, thanks. Are you okay? Thor searches the ground."
16985,Thor,THOR,Hammer...
16986,Thor,JANE,"Erik... look at this. He joins her at her side and sees it. A faint, discernible pattern is etched into the sand. They exchange a look. Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and snaps some photos of the runes. A breeze begins to blow them away."
16987,Thor,JANE,We've got to move fast before anything changes.
16988,Thor,JANE,"We need soil samples, light readings, everything. She pulls out a light meter, holds it up, takes some readings, jots them down in her notebook. Selvig looks at Thor, who stares up at the sky."
16989,Thor,JANE,Not right now. It'll take too long. County's an hour away. We'll drop him off after we're done here. Selvig looks uncertain.
16990,Thor,THOR,Father! Heimdall! I know you can hear me! Open the bridge!
16991,Thor,JANE,"Okay, you and Darcy take him to the hospital, I'll stay here."
16992,Thor,THOR,You! What world is this? The group is intimidated by his fervor.
16993,Thor,THOR,"Where am I?! Answer me! Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it. Jane looks on, concerned."
16994,Thor,JANE,"Erik, just back away..."
16995,Thor,THOR,What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?
16996,Thor,THOR,You dare threaten Thor with so puny
16997,Thor,JANE,"He said it was ""Thor."" The Nurse painstakingly types it into the computer, one key at a time. Jane watches as Thor is wheeled out of the room."
16998,Thor,JANE,I've never met him before.
16999,Thor,JANE,"Grazed him, actually."
17000,Thor,JANE,"I told you, I don't know him. I just want to make sure he's okay."
17001,Thor,JANE,Jane Foster.
17002,Thor,THOR,How dare you attack the son of Odin!
17003,Thor,THOR,"Then bring me a healing stone, you savages! He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall. Now a couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all struggling to hold Thor down. Medical equipment goes flying, furniture overturned."
17004,Thor,THOR,"You're no match for the Mighty-- Thor struggles a beat, then passes out."
17005,Thor,JANE,"Darcy, when you're done, take the soil samples to Professor Meyers in geology. Remind him, he owes me."
17006,Thor,JANE,"""We?"""
17007,Thor,JANE,You know what would be really useful? Do you still have that friend at LIGO?
17008,Thor,JANE,Could you call in a favor?
17009,Thor,JANE,"If I'm right, their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last night's event."
17010,Thor,JANE,Meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger.
17011,Thor,JANE,I think the lensing around the edges is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
17012,Thor,JANE,She was the only applicant.
17013,Thor,JANE,"Erik, look..."
17014,Thor,JANE,What do you see here?
17015,Thor,JANE,"Yes. But not our stars. She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her excitement."
17016,Thor,JANE,"This is the star alignment for our quadrant, this time of year. So unless Ursa Minor decided to take the day off... those are someone else's constellations. Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself. Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the image catches her eye."
17017,Thor,JANE,"I think I left something at the hospital. As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape of a MAN."
17018,Thor,THOR,"It's not possible. He tries again, mustering all his strength. One of his hands slips free from its restraint."
17019,Thor,JANE,"I meant I barely know him anymore. The man he's become. He's changed. I mean, what woman really knows her husband, anyway?"
17020,Thor,JANE,Typical. I just lost my most important piece of evidence.
17021,Thor,JANE,We find him.
17022,Thor,JANE,"I want to know what that thing was, and he may have the answers. We don't have a choice."
17023,Thor,JANE,"However long it takes. Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when --"
17024,Thor,JANE,I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not doing that on purpose.
17025,Thor,THOR,"Blue sky... one sun... This is Earth, isn't it?"
17026,Thor,LOKI,I told him.
17027,Thor,LOKI,I told him to go to Odin after we'd left. Though he should be flogged for taking so long.
17028,Thor,LOKI,I saved our lives! And Thor's. I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.
17029,Thor,LOKI,"And if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous. You saw how he was today. Is that what Asgard needs from its King? The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He leaves the room. Hogun stares after him."
17030,Thor,LOKI,Am I cursed?
17031,Thor,LOKI,What am I?
17032,Thor,LOKI,"What more than that? Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened. Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth."
17033,Thor,LOKI,"The Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it? Odin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer."
17034,Thor,LOKI,Laufey's son... He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.
17035,Thor,LOKI,Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun blood. Why would you take me?
17036,Thor,LOKI,"You took me for a purpose, what was it? Odin doesn't answer."
17037,Thor,LOKI,Tell me!
17038,Thor,LOKI,"So I am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me."
17039,Thor,LOKI,You could have told me what I was from the beginning. Why didn't you?
17040,Thor,LOKI,Because I am the monster parents tell their children about at night?
17041,Thor,LOKI,It all makes sense now. Why you favored Thor all these years.
17042,Thor,LOKI,"Because no matter how much you claim to ""love"" me, you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the Throne of Asgard! Odin's body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of the Odinsleep approaching. Loki doesn't notice as Odin tries to fight it off."
17043,Thor,LOKI,Guards!
17044,Thor,JANE,"Excuse me... excuse me! She leads him away from the work station. Thor holds up the t-shirt. On the front, it bear a sticker which reads: ""HELLO, MY NAME IS DR. DONALD BLAKE"". Thor looks at it, puzzled. Jane rips the sticker off."
17045,Thor,JANE,My ex. Thor stares at her a beat.
17046,Thor,JANE,They're the only clothes I had that'll fit you. Sorry.
17047,Thor,THOR,They will suffice. Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on the wall.
17048,Thor,JANE,You're welcome. Now tell me... Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest. Jane points to his form in the Bifrost photo.
17049,Thor,JANE,"What were you doing, in that? He glances at it, dismissive."
17050,Thor,THOR,"What does anyone do in the Bifrost? Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word. Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within the book, curious."
17051,Thor,JANE,What exactly is the Bifrost?
17052,Thor,JANE,Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart.
17053,Thor,LOKI,So why did he lie?
17054,Thor,LOKI,How long will it last?
17055,Thor,LOKI,I never get used to seeing him like this. The most powerful being in the Nine Realms lying helpless until his body is restored.
17056,Thor,LOKI,What hope is there for Thor?
17057,Thor,JANE,"Now tell us exactly what happened to you last night. Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued. Jane gets flustered, looks away."
17058,Thor,JANE,Maybe start with how you got inside that cloud.
17059,Thor,THOR,This drink. I like it.
17060,Thor,JANE,"Sorry, Izzy. Little accident."
17061,Thor,JANE,What was that? He doesn't understand. The other patrons stare at him.
17062,Thor,THOR,It was delicious. I want another.
17063,Thor,JANE,Then you should just say so!
17064,Thor,THOR,I just did.
17065,Thor,JANE,I mean ask for it. Nicely.
17066,Thor,THOR,I meant no disrespect.
17067,Thor,JANE,"All right, then no more smashing, deal?"
17068,Thor,THOR,You have my word.
17069,Thor,JANE,Good.
17070,Thor,JANE,"Excuse me, did you say there was a satellite crash?"
17071,Thor,THOR,Where?!
17072,Thor,JANE,Where are you going?
17073,Thor,THOR,Twelve miles east of here. He starts to stride determinedly down the street. Jane walks with him.
17074,Thor,JANE,Why?
17075,Thor,THOR,To get what belongs to me.
17076,Thor,JANE,So now you own a satellite?
17077,Thor,THOR,It's not what they say it is.
17078,Thor,JANE,"Whatever it is, the government seems to think it's theirs. You intend to just walk in there and take it?"
17079,Thor,THOR,Yes. He stops walking.
17080,Thor,THOR,"If you take me there now, I'll tell you everything you wish to know."
17081,Thor,JANE,Everything?
17082,Thor,THOR,"All the answers you seek will be yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir. Darcy looks to the others."
17083,Thor,JANE,You know what we saw last night. This can't be a coincidence. I want to know what's in that crater.
17084,Thor,JANE,He's promised us answers.
17085,Thor,JANE,"I'd just be driving him out there, that's all."
17086,Thor,JANE,I'm sorry. I can't take you.
17087,Thor,THOR,I understand. Then this is where we say goodbye. He takes her hand and kisses it.
17088,Thor,JANE,That's... thank you. Thor bows slightly to each of them.
17089,Thor,THOR,Jane Foster... Erik Selvig... Darcy. Farewell. He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved.
17090,Thor,LOKI,"Sitting sprawled upon his father's throne. He wears his horned ceremonial headdress and holds GUNGNIR in his hand. Sif and the others look up, shocked at the sight before them."
17091,Thor,LOKI,My friends... you haven't heard? I am now Ruler of Asgard.
17092,Thor,LOKI,Father's fallen into the Odinsleep. My mother fears he may never awaken again.
17093,Thor,LOKI,"She has refused to leave my father's bedside. You can bring your ""urgent"" matter to me, your King. Sif covers quickly."
17094,Thor,LOKI,"My first command can not be to undo the Allfather's last. We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim. Our people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times. Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of this."
17095,Thor,LOKI,"All of us must stand together, for the good of Asgard."
17096,Thor,JANE,Hey! That's my stuff!
17097,Thor,JANE,What the hell is going on here?! The Agents ignore her as Agent Coulson approaches.
17098,Thor,JANE,"I don't care who you work for, you can't do this!"
17099,Thor,JANE,Let it go?! This is my life!
17100,Thor,JANE,"By ""appropriate"" you mean ""steal?"" Instead of answering, Coulson gives her a check."
17101,Thor,JANE,I can't just pick up replacements from RadioShack! I made most of that equipment myself!
17102,Thor,JANE,And I'm sure I can sue you for violating my constitutional rights!
17103,Thor,JANE,So are we! We're on the verge of
17104,Thor,JANE,"Everything I know about this phenomenon is in this lab and in this book, and no one has the right to take it from me. Coulson gestures to a nearby AGENT, who promptly plucks the notebook out of Jane's hands and adds it to the pile he's carrying. Jane is stunned."
17105,Thor,JANE,"Years of research, gone."
17106,Thor,JANE,Look around! They took our back- ups. They took the back-ups of our back-ups.
17107,Thor,JANE,I'm not going to let them do this. I'm getting everything back.
17108,Thor,THOR,I need a horse.
17109,Thor,THOR,"Then give me one of those, large enough to ride. The Pet Store Clerk looks confused. Just then, Thor hears a CAR HORN. He turns to the open door. Across the street, Jane calls to him from the Pinzgauer."
17110,Thor,JANE,You still want a lift?
17111,Thor,JANE,I've never done anything like this before! Have you ever done anything like this before? Thor looks amused by her excitement.
17112,Thor,THOR,Many times. You're brave to do it.
17113,Thor,JANE,They just stole my entire life's work. I really don't have anything left to lose.
17114,Thor,THOR,But you're clever. Far more clever than anyone else in this Realm.
17115,Thor,JANE,"""This Realm?"" Why do you talk like that?"
17116,Thor,THOR,"You think me strange? Jane laughs, catches herself."
17117,Thor,JANE,Yeah. Just a little.
17118,Thor,THOR,Good strange or bad strange?
17119,Thor,JANE,"I'm not quite sure yet. She looks at him, sees him staring at her. She's lost in his gaze, distracted, when the PINZGAUER LURCHES. She quickly turns her eyes forward, regains control of the car."
17120,Thor,JANE,"Sorry. She glances back at him. He's confident, determined."
17121,Thor,JANE,Who are you? Really?
17122,Thor,THOR,You'll see soon enough.
17123,Thor,JANE,You promised me answers.
17124,Thor,THOR,What you seek -- it's a bridge.
17125,Thor,JANE,A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?
17126,Thor,THOR,More like a rainbow bridge.
17127,Thor,JANE,"God, I hope you're not crazy."
17128,Thor,JANE,"That isn't a satellite crash. They would have hauled the wreckage away, not built a city around it. Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her."
17129,Thor,THOR,You're going to need this.
17130,Thor,JANE,Why?-- Thunder RUMBLES overhead. She stares at him intently and takes his jacket.
17131,Thor,THOR,"Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I will return what they stole from you."
17132,Thor,THOR,Deal?
17133,Thor,JANE,"No! Look what's down there! You can't just walk in, grab our stuff, and walk out!"
17134,Thor,THOR,No. Jane looks relieved.
17135,Thor,THOR,"I'm going to fly out. Before she can react, he starts heading towards the crater. The first drops of rain begin to patter into the dust."
17136,Thor,JANE,Wait... But Thor is already headed towards the crater.
17137,Thor,JANE,"Erik, okay, first of all, don't worry. I'm perfectly fine, really. More sounds of MAYHEM come from the base."
17138,Thor,JANE,"But if you don't hear from me again, you might want to come out to the crater site and look for me. I kind of did what you said I shouldn't do. Thanks. Bye. She hangs up."
17139,Thor,THOR,You're big. Thor grins.
17140,Thor,THOR,Fought bigger.
17141,Thor,JANE,No...
17142,Thor,JANE,I can't just leave him there.
17143,Thor,JANE,You didn't see what happened. Darcy points at an illustration of Thor's hammer in the book.
17144,Thor,JANE,"Aren't you the one who's always told me to chase down all leads, all possibilities?"
17145,Thor,JANE,Magic's just science we don't understand yet. Arthur C. Clarke.
17146,Thor,JANE,The precursor of science fact.
17147,Thor,JANE,"If that's really an Einstein-Rosen Bridge out there, then there's something on the other side."
17148,Thor,JANE,Advanced beings could have come through it before.
17149,Thor,JANE,Yes! Exactly! Thank you! Darcy beams.
17150,Thor,THOR,Just a man.
17151,Thor,LOKI,"I thought he'd never leave. Thor looks up, shocked to find Loki standing there, dressed in 21st century attire."
17152,Thor,THOR,Loki? What are you doing here?
17153,Thor,LOKI,I had to see you.
17154,Thor,THOR,What's happened? Tell me! Is it Jotunheim? Let me explain to
17155,Thor,LOKI,"Father is dead. Thor stares at him, stunned."
17156,Thor,THOR,What?
17157,Thor,LOKI,"Your banishment, the threat of a new war, it was too much for him to bear. The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's responsible for his father's fate. Loki draws close to him, looks in his eyes, consolingly."
17158,Thor,LOKI,"You mustn't blame yourself. I know that you loved him. I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen."
17159,Thor,LOKI,The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.
17160,Thor,THOR,Can I come home?
17161,Thor,LOKI,The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.
17162,Thor,THOR,But couldn't we find a way to--
17163,Thor,LOKI,"Mother has forbidden your return. Thor nods, lowers his head, beaten."
17164,Thor,LOKI,"This is goodbye, brother. I'm so sorry."
17165,Thor,THOR,"No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you for coming here."
17166,Thor,LOKI,"Nothing could have stopped me. Coulson enters the room, but seems to take no notice of Loki."
17167,Thor,LOKI,"Fare well, brother."
17168,Thor,THOR,Good-bye.
17169,Thor,LOKI,I've come alone and unarmed.
17170,Thor,LOKI,To make you another proposition.
17171,Thor,LOKI,You're welcome.
17172,Thor,LOKI,"You have no idea what I am. The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the guards stare in shock. Loki grins."
17173,Thor,LOKI,"Hello, Father. Laufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal. Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son."
17174,Thor,LOKI,"No longer weak. I now rule Asgard, until Odin awakens. Perhaps you should not have so carelessly abandoned me. This gives Laufey pause."
17175,Thor,LOKI,"I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers, lead you into his chambers, and let you slay him where he lies. I'll keep the throne, and you will have the Casket. Laufey studies Loki's face."
17176,Thor,LOKI,"When all is done, we will have a permanent peace between our two worlds. Then I, the bastard son, will have accomplished what Odin and Thor never could."
17177,Thor,LOKI,"No. Asgard is mine. The rest of the Nine Realms will be yours, if you do as you're told. Laufey considers the proposition."
17178,Thor,LOKI,"What troubles you, Gatekeeper?"
17179,Thor,LOKI,Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.
17180,Thor,LOKI,"You have great power, Heimdall. Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?"
17181,Thor,LOKI,And why is that?
17182,Thor,LOKI,Exactly. Just as you're sworn to obey me now. Yes? A beat.
17183,Thor,LOKI,Good. Then you will open the Bifrost to no one until I have undone what my brother has started. Loki heads out of the Observatory. Heimdall stares after him.
17184,Thor,THOR,Thank you for what you've done.
17185,Thor,THOR,Are you in love with her?
17186,Thor,THOR,Neither did I. Selvig eyes him with interest.
17187,Thor,THOR,"I swear to you, I mean her no harm."
17188,Thor,THOR,I had it all backwards. I had it all wrong. Selvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than he's seen before.
17189,Thor,THOR,"For the first time in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do."
17190,Thor,THOR,I have no quarrel with you. But she's a lady. You should be more respectful.
17191,Thor,THOR,I will not fight him.
17192,Thor,THOR,Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his shoulder.
17193,Thor,JANE,Erik!
17194,Thor,THOR,He's fine. Not injured at all.
17195,Thor,THOR,"Sorry, my friend."
17196,Thor,JANE,What happened?
17197,Thor,THOR,We drank. We fought. He made his ancestors proud.
17198,Thor,JANE,"Put him on the bed. Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes."
17199,Thor,THOR,These are your chambers? Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up the mess around her.
17200,Thor,JANE,"Well, it's more of a temporary living space, really. I don't usually have visitors in here. Actually, never... Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from him, puts it away."
17201,Thor,JANE,Can we go outside?
17202,Thor,JANE,I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to reconcile particle data. Or when Darcy's driving me crazy.
17203,Thor,JANE,I'm glad you're safe.
17204,Thor,THOR,You've been very kind. I've been far less grateful than you deserve.
17205,Thor,JANE,"I also hit you with my car a couple times, so it kind of evens out. He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her"
17206,Thor,JANE,"I don't believe it... She takes it from him, surprised and grateful."
17207,Thor,THOR,It was all I could get back. Not as much as I promised. I'm sorry.
17208,Thor,JANE,"No, this is good. Thank you. This means I don't have to start from scratch... She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a harsh realization clouding her face. Thor notices."
17209,Thor,THOR,What's wrong?
17210,Thor,JANE,"SHIELD, whatever they are. They're never going to let this research see the light of day."
17211,Thor,THOR,You must do this. You must finish what you've started.
17212,Thor,JANE,Why?
17213,Thor,THOR,Because you're right. It's taken so many generations for your people to get to this point. You're nearly there. You just need someone to show you how close you really are.
17214,Thor,THOR,"Look -- your ancestors called it magic. You call it science. I come from a place where they're one and the same thing. We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil as she looks on, amazed and intrigued."
17215,Thor,JANE,What is it?
17216,Thor,THOR,This is how my father explained it to me...
17217,Thor,THOR,"You're very welcome. Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates. She and Thor sit with the others and start to eat their breakfast, looking like a little family."
17218,Thor,THOR,Thank you. Excuse me a moment. Thor leaves.
17219,Thor,THOR,To replace the one I broke. Please forgive my behavior.
17220,Thor,THOR,"If I may, I'd like to come back for more of your ""coffee."""
17221,Thor,LOKI,"You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of the Realm? There are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am King."
17222,Thor,LOKI,Ensure my brother does not return.
17223,Thor,THOR,"My friends! Thor happily races over and greets his comrades. Jane, Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the room. Jane looks concerned. Selvig and Darcy eye them with wonder."
17224,Thor,JANE,That would have been a thousand years ago? Northern Europe?
17225,Thor,THOR,"My friends, I've never been happier to see anyone. But you should not have come."
17226,Thor,THOR,You know I can't. My father is dead because of me. I must remain in exile. The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks.
17227,Thor,THOR,Leave this town now. Get yourself and your friends to safety.
17228,Thor,JANE,What about you?
17229,Thor,THOR,I must stay and fight. The Asgardians look to Thor.
17230,Thor,THOR,"I'm still a warrior, and I will fight by your side."
17231,Thor,THOR,"Help me clear the streets. I'll let none of these people die this day. Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy start to herd the crowd of Townsfolk off the streets, as the Warriors Three and Sif head across town, towards the Destroyer."
17232,Thor,LOKI,Father. Welcome to Asgard.
17233,Thor,JANE,"Erik! She and Thor hurry to his side. He's losing blood, going into shock."
17234,Thor,THOR,"Come on... give me one! Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over the end of the iron rod."
17235,Thor,JANE,"What are you doing? What is that? As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it. Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it reaches Selvig's wound. The powder heals his wound completely. Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed flesh."
17236,Thor,THOR,"Go, while you can!"
17237,Thor,THOR,You can't help them now. Your job is to survive. She struggles to sit up.
17238,Thor,THOR,"Live and tell those stories yourself. At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious, with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way towards them. Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He rouses Hogun and Fandral."
17239,Thor,THOR,"But not win. Move Volstagg, or he'll die! Thor looks at them, grins."
17240,Thor,THOR,"Don't worry, my friends. I have a plan. The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and drag him away from the battlefield. After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then tosses Sif's shield aside. He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely defenseless."
17241,Thor,THOR,"Brother... for whatever I have done to wrong you, whatever I have done to lead you to do this, I am sorry. But these people have done nothing to you. They are innocents. He continues towards the Destroyer."
17242,Thor,THOR,"Take my life, and know I will never return to Asgard."
17243,Thor,JANE,Oh. My. God.
17244,Thor,THOR,Heimdall! Open the Bifrost!
17245,Thor,THOR,He would open it if he could. I fear the worst.
17246,Thor,THOR,Heimdall!
17247,Thor,THOR,"Know this, son of Coul. You and I, we fight for the same cause -- the protection of this world. From this day forward, count me as your ally."
17248,Thor,THOR,"Whatever fate lies before me, you are part of it. He takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately. Thor and the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost."
17249,Thor,THOR,Get him to the healing room! Leave my brother to me.
17250,Thor,LOKI,And your death came by the son of Odin.
17251,Thor,LOKI,"I swear to you, mother, they will pay for what they've done today. I will end the Jotun threat, now and forever! He looks to Odin."
17252,Thor,LOKI,"And I will make you proud. Loki savors the moment, but it's short-lived, as Thor bursts in. He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and respect. Stunned and delighted to see Thor, Frigga beams."
17253,Thor,LOKI,"Found its way back to you, did it?"
17254,Thor,THOR,No thanks to you. Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons.
17255,Thor,THOR,"Why don't you tell her? How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends? To kill me? Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused."
17256,Thor,LOKI,It must have been enforcing Father's last command.
17257,Thor,THOR,"You're a talented liar, brother. Always have been."
17258,Thor,THOR,Jotunheim...
17259,Thor,LOKI,"All these years, and no one's ever dared to use it as a weapon. Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through it to get to the controls frozen within. Before he can, Loki fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor, blasting him back across the floor. Loki steps down from the ice as Thor staggers to his feet."
17260,Thor,LOKI,You can't stop it. The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart.
17261,Thor,THOR,Why have you done this?
17262,Thor,LOKI,"To do what Father never could. To destroy their kind forever. When he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of what I've done."
17263,Thor,THOR,He won't! You can't kill an entire race!
17264,Thor,LOKI,"What is this newfound love for the Frost Giants? You, who would have killed them all with your bare hands."
17265,Thor,THOR,I've changed.
17266,Thor,LOKI,So have I. Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.
17267,Thor,LOKI,"Fight me. He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his hand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow, but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back towards the frozen controls. Loki spins around, aims Gungnir, and fires a blast which immobilizes Thor in the air. He hangs there, suspended."
17268,Thor,THOR,Is the throne really worth what you've done? What you would become?
17269,Thor,LOKI,I never wanted the throne. I only wanted to be your equal. Now fight me!
17270,Thor,THOR,"I will not fight you, brother."
17271,Thor,LOKI,I am not your brother. I never was.
17272,Thor,THOR,"Loki, this is madness... Loki grins."
17273,Thor,LOKI,"Is it? He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to his feet."
17274,Thor,LOKI,"What happened to you on earth that turned you so soft? Don't tell me it was a woman. Thor doesn't answer. Loki laughs, realizing he's right."
17275,Thor,LOKI,"It was. Perhaps when we're finished here I'll pay her a little visit myself. That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing years of pent-up rage and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself."
17276,Thor,JANE,Something's wrong.
17277,Thor,LOKI,"If you care so much for the Jotuns, then die with them. The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand towards the Bifrost. MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand. The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his brother."
17278,Thor,LOKI,"Thor! Help me! Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking up at him desperately."
17279,Thor,LOKI,"Please... Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir. Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls him across the bridge."
17280,Thor,THOR,"Yet still not clever enough. With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air, summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the Lokis. All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir knocked from his grasp. Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps away. Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's pinned to the ground. Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to do. Loki watches him smugly."
17281,Thor,LOKI,"Look at you, the Mighty Thor. With all your strength, what good does it do you now? Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet, VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea. He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice. Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused."
17282,Thor,LOKI,"Stop! What are you doing?! Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM! The crack grows bigger. The Bifrost energy starts to stream out from it. Loki thinks fast."
17283,Thor,LOKI,"If you destroy the Bridge, you'll never see her again! Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor through the back."
17284,Thor,THOR,"Forgive me. Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow -- KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING out of it. Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes. The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART. As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out from the broken Bridge. They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized by the debris, when --"
17285,Thor,THOR,"No! But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the Observatory, disappearing out of sight. Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back into his father's arms."
17286,Thor,JANE,It's gone.
17287,Thor,THOR,There will never be a wiser king than you. Or a better father.
17288,Thor,THOR,"Can you see her? Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth."
17289,Thor,THOR,How is she?
17290,Thor,JANE,Thanks. Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.
17291,Thor,JANE,"I know. But if he can't get here on his own... Jane hits a switch on the device. Suddenly, a 3-D HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device, bathing the two women in its glow. We recognize what it is -- YGGDRASIL, in all its beauty."
17292,Thor,JANE,...maybe we can help him find his way back.
17293,Twilight,BELLA,I'd never given much thought to how I would die..
17294,Twilight,BELLA,Have a good..
17295,Twilight,BELLA,... life.
17296,Twilight,BELLA,You put it on hold.
17297,Twilight,BELLA,Look. You also called Mexico.
17298,Twilight,BELLA,Very romantic.
17299,Twilight,PHIL,"If you call crappy motels, backwater towns and ballpark hot dogs romantic."
17300,Twilight,BELLA,"I won't change my mind, mom."
17301,Twilight,BELLA,"It's not about Forks, it's about Dad. I mean, two weeks a year, we barely know each other."
17302,Twilight,BELLA,I cut it since last time I saw you.
17303,Twilight,BELLA,Good.
17304,Twilight,BELLA,That's right. One bathroom.
17305,Twilight,BELLA,I can do it
17306,Twilight,BELLA,Yeah... I think I remember.. Are they always like this?
17307,Twilight,BELLA,No way. The truck is for me?
17308,Twilight,BELLA,It's perfect!
17309,Twilight,BELLA,Maybe I can give you a ride to school.
17310,Twilight,BELLA,Too bad. Would've been nice to know at least one person.
17311,Twilight,BELLA,I'm kind of the suffer in silence type.
17312,Twilight,BELLA,"I -- no, I'm not news -- I'm, seriously, not at all"
17313,Twilight,BELLA,"(hurries to him,"
17314,Twilight,BELLA,Just Bella.
17315,Twilight,BELLA,That's why they kicked me out.
17316,Twilight,BELLA,"Sorry. There's always eating disorders, or Speedo padding on the swim team"
17317,Twilight,BELLA,Who are they?
17318,Twilight,BELLA,Who's he?
17319,Twilight,BELLA,I wasn't planning on it.
17320,Twilight,EDWARD,I'll just... endure it.
17321,Twilight,BELLA,Jerk.
17322,Twilight,BELLA,"That'd be great, thank you."
17323,Twilight,BELLA,So... you eat here every night?
17324,Twilight,BELLA,I can cook.
17325,Twilight,BELLA,I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix. Mom's not great in the kitchen.
17326,Twilight,BELLA,A few people... Do you know the Cullen family?
17327,Twilight,BELLA,"No... well, a little."
17328,Twilight,BELLA,... Okay.
17329,Twilight,BELLA,"Mom, where's your cell?"
17330,Twilight,BELLA,"Dad, I'm heading out. EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - MORNING ON BELLA'S FACE as she opens the door and stops, dismay filling her. It's pouring down rain --the yard is full of puddles, some frozen. Bella shivers, wraps her coat tight."
17331,Twilight,BELLA,Great. WHIP PAN to the driveway as Charlie pulls in -driving her truck.
17332,Twilight,BELLA,"Dad, I can drive myself to school."
17333,Twilight,BELLA,Ice doesn't help the uncoordinated.
17334,Twilight,BELLA,You got me new tires. No one's ever done that before.
17335,Twilight,BELLA,I mean... nothing.
17336,Twilight,BELLA,An animal?
17337,Twilight,BELLA,Be careful.
17338,Twilight,BELLA,And thank you. For the tires.
17339,Twilight,BELLA,Terrific.
17340,Twilight,EDWARD,Hello.
17341,Twilight,EDWARD,I didn't have a chance to introduce myself last week. My name is Edward Cullen.
17342,Twilight,EDWARD,... You're Bella.
17343,Twilight,BELLA,I'm... yes.
17344,Twilight,EDWARD,Ladies first.
17345,Twilight,BELLA,You've been gone.
17346,Twilight,EDWARD,Out of town. For personal reasons.
17347,Twilight,BELLA,Prophase.
17348,Twilight,EDWARD,May I look?
17349,Twilight,EDWARD,Prophase.
17350,Twilight,BELLA,Like I said.
17351,Twilight,EDWARD,Enjoying the rain?
17352,Twilight,BELLA,Seriously? You're asking me about the weather?
17353,Twilight,EDWARD,It appears.
17354,Twilight,BELLA,No. I don't like the cold. Or the wet. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or turtle necks.
17355,Twilight,BELLA,May I?
17356,Twilight,EDWARD,Like I said.
17357,Twilight,BELLA,It's complicated.
17358,Twilight,EDWARD,I think I can keep up.
17359,Twilight,BELLA,My mother remarried.
17360,Twilight,EDWARD,Very complex. So you don't like him.
17361,Twilight,BELLA,"Phil is fine. Young for her, but nice enough."
17362,Twilight,EDWARD,But now you're unhappy.
17363,Twilight,BELLA,No... I -- I just..
17364,Twilight,BELLA,Did you get contacts?
17365,Twilight,EDWARD,... no.
17366,Twilight,EDWARD,It's just the fluorescents.
17367,Twilight,BELLA,"I'm fine, dad. Calm down."
17368,Twilight,BELLA,"It's okay, Tyler."
17369,Twilight,BELLA,"Dad, it's not his fault-"
17370,Twilight,BELLA,But you didn't.
17371,Twilight,BELLA,It would have been a lot worse if Edward hadn't knocked me out of the way.
17372,Twilight,BELLA,It was amazing he got to me so fast. He was nowhere near me.
17373,Twilight,BELLA,You told her?! She's probably freaking.
17374,Twilight,BELLA,Can I talk to you for a moment? How did you get over to me so quickly?
17375,Twilight,EDWARD,I was standing right next to you.
17376,Twilight,BELLA,"You were next to your car, across the lot."
17377,Twilight,BELLA,Yes. You were.
17378,Twilight,EDWARD,You're confused. You hit your head.
17379,Twilight,BELLA,I know what I saw.
17380,Twilight,EDWARD,"And what, exactly, was that?"
17381,Twilight,BELLA,You stopped that van. You pushed it away.
17382,Twilight,EDWARD,No one will believe that.
17383,Twilight,BELLA,I wasn't planning to tell anyone.
17384,Twilight,BELLA,I just want to know the truth.
17385,Twilight,EDWARD,Can't you just thank me and get over it?
17386,Twilight,EDWARD,"You're not going to let it go, are you?"
17387,Twilight,BELLA,No.
17388,Twilight,EDWARD,Then I hope you enjoy disappointment.
17389,Twilight,BELLA,Why did you even bother?
17390,Twilight,EDWARD,... I don't know.
17391,Twilight,BELLA,"... Yeah, false alarm.."
17392,Twilight,BELLA,"Prom. As in dance. I, uh - have to go"
17393,Twilight,BELLA,Non-refundable ticket. Maybe you should ask Jessica.
17394,Twilight,BELLA,"Hello, Edward."
17395,Twilight,BELLA,Really?
17396,Twilight,EDWARD,What's in Jacksonville?
17397,Twilight,BELLA,How did you know about that?
17398,Twilight,EDWARD,You didn't answer my question.
17399,Twilight,BELLA,You haven't answered any of mine. You won't even say hello.
17400,Twilight,EDWARD,Hello.
17401,Twilight,BELLA,And how did you stop that van?
17402,Twilight,EDWARD,Adrenaline rush. Very common. Google it.
17403,Twilight,EDWARD,It helps if you actually watch where you put your feet.
17404,Twilight,EDWARD,"I know I've been rude, but it's for the best."
17405,Twilight,BELLA,No way. Zero weirdness. You guys are great together.
17406,Twilight,EDWARD,"Bella, it would be better if we weren't friends."
17407,Twilight,EDWARD,You think I regret saving you?
17408,Twilight,BELLA,I know you do.
17409,Twilight,EDWARD,You don't know anything.
17410,Twilight,EDWARD,No. Our bus is full.
17411,Twilight,BELLA,"Your fault, for telling her about the accident."
17412,Twilight,BELLA,He is.
17413,Twilight,BELLA,Should I know what that means?
17414,Twilight,BELLA,I'll go if you stop saying that.
17415,Twilight,EDWARD,Edible art..
17416,Twilight,BELLA,Thanks... but your mood swings are giving me whiplash.
17417,Twilight,EDWARD,"I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be."
17418,Twilight,BELLA,What does that even mean?
17419,Twilight,EDWARD,"It means if you were smart, you'd avoid me."
17420,Twilight,BELLA,"So let's say, for argument's sake, that I'm not smart. Would you talk to me? Tell me the truth?"
17421,Twilight,EDWARD,Probably not. I'd rather hear your theories.
17422,Twilight,BELLA,Okay... how bout radioactive spiders? Kryptonite?
17423,Twilight,EDWARD,"(levels his gaze,"
17424,Twilight,BELLA,"No. I don't believe that. You're not bad. You can be a jerk, but it's like this... mask. To keep people away."
17425,Twilight,BELLA,"Look, why don't we just - hang out. Like... come to the beach with us. It'll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn, salt water stinging your eyes.."
17426,Twilight,EDWARD,Which beach?
17427,Twilight,BELLA,La Push.
17428,Twilight,BELLA,Is something wrong with that beach?
17429,Twilight,EDWARD,It's just a little crowded.
17430,Twilight,BELLA,You could ask him. (off Angela's flustered
17431,Twilight,BELLA,"Guys, this is Jacob. Are you stalking me?"
17432,Twilight,BELLA,Definitely not.
17433,Twilight,BELLA,To be polite.
17434,Twilight,SAM,You got that right.
17435,Twilight,BELLA,You know them?
17436,Twilight,SAM,The Cullens don't come here.
17437,Twilight,BELLA,You want to go look at tide pools?
17438,Twilight,BELLA,"So, what did your friend mean about the Cullens not coming here?"
17439,Twilight,BELLA,I can keep a secret..
17440,Twilight,BELLA,"Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath?"
17441,Twilight,BELLA,So the legend about the Cullens is..
17442,Twilight,BELLA,Didn't they just move here?
17443,Twilight,BELLA,Riiiight. So what was this treaty?
17444,Twilight,BELLA,Wait... what were they really?
17445,Twilight,BELLA,They just... ditch?
17446,Twilight,BELLA,It's a family thing.
17447,Twilight,BELLA,Port Angeles?.. Can I go with you guys?
17448,Twilight,BELLA,It looks great.
17449,Twilight,BELLA,"Look, just take my bag."
17450,Twilight,EDWARD,Get in.
17451,Twilight,BELLA,"What -- no, how did you find --"
17452,Twilight,EDWARD,I should go back and rip their heads off.
17453,Twilight,BELLA,No. Bad idea.
17454,Twilight,EDWARD,"You don't know the vile, repulsive things they were thinking."
17455,Twilight,BELLA,And you do?
17456,Twilight,EDWARD,Not hard to guess.
17457,Twilight,EDWARD,Sorry I kept Bella from dinner. We ran into each other and got talking.
17458,Twilight,BELLA,"Okay, well. Thank you."
17459,Twilight,BELLA,I could eat.
17460,Twilight,BELLA,You're not eating?
17461,Twilight,EDWARD,I'm on a special diet.
17462,Twilight,BELLA,Like South Beach?
17463,Twilight,EDWARD,Not exactly.
17464,Twilight,BELLA,So how bout some answers?
17465,Twilight,EDWARD,"Yes, no. To get to the other side, and 1 point 772453851."
17466,Twilight,BELLA,I didn't ask for the square root of pi.
17467,Twilight,EDWARD,You knew that?
17468,Twilight,BELLA,How did you know where I was?
17469,Twilight,EDWARD,I didn't.
17470,Twilight,EDWARD,Don't go.
17471,Twilight,BELLA,Were you following me?
17472,Twilight,EDWARD,I feel very protective of you.
17473,Twilight,BELLA,So that's a yes?
17474,Twilight,EDWARD,"Yes, I followed you. I tried to keep my distance...until you needed help."
17475,Twilight,BELLA,You said before... That you heard what those guys were thinking.. Can you... read minds?
17476,Twilight,EDWARD,"I have no idea. I can read every mind in there, except yours."
17477,Twilight,BELLA,"Why, what's wrong with me?"
17478,Twilight,EDWARD,I tell you I read minds and you think there's something wrong with you?
17479,Twilight,BELLA,What is it?
17480,Twilight,EDWARD,I... don't have the strength to stay away from you anymore.
17481,Twilight,BELLA,"Edward, you don't have to."
17482,Twilight,EDWARD,This is wrong.
17483,Twilight,BELLA,Edward
17484,Twilight,EDWARD,You're cold. We should go.
17485,Twilight,BELLA,I think I'm warm enough now.
17486,Twilight,BELLA,"Your hand, it's still freezing cold."
17487,Twilight,EDWARD,That's my father's car. What's he --
17488,Twilight,EDWARD,Carlisle. What happened?
17489,Twilight,BELLA,He died? How?
17490,Twilight,BELLA,The same kind that killed the security guard down in Mason?
17491,Twilight,BELLA,So it's getting closer to town.
17492,Twilight,EDWARD,Waylon lived all the way down on Queets River. 75 miles south.
17493,Twilight,BELLA,But that's
17494,Twilight,BELLA,"Dad, I'm sorry about Waylon."
17495,Twilight,BELLA,That's probably not a good
17496,Twilight,BELLA,"... it's not possible.. Off BELLA'S FACE, struggling to make sense of it all.. MATCH CUT:"
17497,Twilight,BELLA,"You're impossibly fast. And strong. Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold. Your eyes change color. And sometimes you speak like... you're from a different time."
17498,Twilight,BELLA,How old are you?
17499,Twilight,EDWARD,Seventeen.
17500,Twilight,BELLA,How long have you been seventeen?
17501,Twilight,EDWARD,... A while.
17502,Twilight,BELLA,I know what the Cold Ones are. What you are.
17503,Twilight,EDWARD,Say it. Out loud. Say it.
17504,Twilight,BELLA,... Vampire
17505,Twilight,EDWARD,Are you afraid?
17506,Twilight,BELLA,No.
17507,Twilight,BELLA,You won't hurt me. You're different.
17508,Twilight,EDWARD,You think you know me?
17509,Twilight,BELLA,Where are we going?
17510,Twilight,EDWARD,Up the mountain. Out of the cloud bank. You need to see what really am. What I look like in the harsh light of the sun.
17511,Twilight,BELLA,No! The sunlight will kill you.
17512,Twilight,EDWARD,Myth. You need to see the truth.
17513,Twilight,BELLA,Slow down.
17514,Twilight,EDWARD,Are you afraid?
17515,Twilight,BELLA,No.
17516,Twilight,EDWARD,Then come with me. Someplace where no one can protect you. Where could do what I've wanted to do from the first moment I met you.
17517,Twilight,BELLA,I'm not afraid.
17518,Twilight,EDWARD,Hold on.
17519,Twilight,EDWARD,Are you afraid!
17520,Twilight,BELLA,No!
17521,Twilight,BELLA,Edward? Where are you?
17522,Twilight,EDWARD,This is what I am.
17523,Twilight,BELLA,You're... beautiful..
17524,Twilight,BELLA,I don't believe that.
17525,Twilight,EDWARD,"Because you believe the lie. The camouflage. I'm the world's most dangerous predator. Everything about me invites you in - my voice, my face, even my smell. As if need any of that.."
17526,Twilight,EDWARD,As if you could outrun me. As if you could fight me off.
17527,Twilight,EDWARD,I'm designed to kill.
17528,Twilight,BELLA,I don't care.
17529,Twilight,EDWARD,I've killed people.
17530,Twilight,BELLA,It doesn't matter.
17531,Twilight,EDWARD,I wanted to kill you. I've never wanted a human's blood so much in my life. I'm dangerous to you.
17532,Twilight,BELLA,I trust you.
17533,Twilight,EDWARD,Don't.
17534,Twilight,BELLA,"I trust you, Edward. I'm here."
17535,Twilight,BELLA,Edward?
17536,Twilight,EDWARD,You... took me by surprise. I don't know how to... do this.
17537,Twilight,EDWARD,"Me, and my family, we're different from others of our kind. We're not nomadic, we have a permanent home. We only hunt animals. We've learned to control our thirst.."
17538,Twilight,BELLA,Oh... I thought you hated me when we met.
17539,Twilight,EDWARD,I did. For making me want you so badly. I'm still not sure I can control myself.
17540,Twilight,BELLA,I know you can.
17541,Twilight,EDWARD,I wish I could understand this thing you see in me. You look at me with those eyes..
17542,Twilight,BELLA,I'm afraid.
17543,Twilight,EDWARD,Good.
17544,Twilight,BELLA,Not of that. I'm afraid... you'll disappear. That I'll lose you.
17545,Twilight,EDWARD,Be very still.
17546,Twilight,EDWARD,And so the lion fell for the lamb.
17547,Twilight,BELLA,Stupid lamb.
17548,Twilight,EDWARD,Sick masochistic lion.
17549,Twilight,BELLA,How long have you been like this?
17550,Twilight,EDWARD,Since nineteen-eighteen. That's when Carlisle found me.
17551,Twilight,BELLA,Where'd he find you?
17552,Twilight,EDWARD,"In a hospital, dying of Spanish influenza. My parents had already died."
17553,Twilight,EDWARD,"Not just. Our bite contains venom. And once we taste blood, a sort of.. frenzy begins. It's almost impossible to stop."
17554,Twilight,EDWARD,"First with me, then with his wife, Esme. He found her in a hospital, as well. The others followed."
17555,Twilight,BELLA,Does someone have to be dying to become like you?..
17556,Twilight,EDWARD,"... No, that's just Carlisle. He would never do... this, to someone who had another choice."
17557,Twilight,BELLA,"So Carlisle's the reason why you hunt animals, instead of people."
17558,Twilight,EDWARD,Not the only reason.
17559,Twilight,EDWARD,I don't want to be a monster.
17560,Twilight,EDWARD,"We call ourselves vegetarians, by the way... For our kind, hunting animals is like living on tofu. It keeps you strong but isn't very satisfying."
17561,Twilight,BELLA,Show off.
17562,Twilight,EDWARD,"It's not that impressive, really. Anyone in my family can do this."
17563,Twilight,BELLA,"Can they all read minds, too?"
17564,Twilight,EDWARD,"No, that's unique to me. But Alice can see the future."
17565,Twilight,EDWARD,Her visions are very subjective. The future can change.
17566,Twilight,EDWARD,Come to my house tomorrow.
17567,Twilight,BELLA,Your house? With your family?
17568,Twilight,BELLA,But... what if they don't like me?
17569,Twilight,BELLA,I'm glad I amuse you.
17570,Twilight,BELLA,What is it?
17571,Twilight,EDWARD,A complication.
17572,Twilight,EDWARD,I'll pick you up tomorrow.
17573,Twilight,BELLA,Come to visit your truck?
17574,Twilight,BELLA,A person did that?
17575,Twilight,BELLA,It's... wonderful.
17576,Twilight,EDWARD,"You expected turrets, dungeons and moats?"
17577,Twilight,BELLA,No... not moats. He takes her hand. She girds herself. They head inside.
17578,Twilight,BELLA,It's so light and open.
17579,Twilight,EDWARD,Thanks to tinted windows... It's the one place we never have to hide.
17580,Twilight,EDWARD,I told them not to do this.
17581,Twilight,BELLA,Bon giorno?
17582,Twilight,BELLA,"Oh, absolutely"
17583,Twilight,EDWARD,She already ate.
17584,Twilight,BELLA,"I just assumed -- because you don't eat, you know.."
17585,Twilight,EDWARD,Ignore her. I do.
17586,Twilight,BELLA,"I would never, ever tell anyone."
17587,Twilight,BELLA,... Badly?
17588,Twilight,EDWARD,Alice. ALICE
17589,Twilight,BELLA,"And you're Jasper, right?"
17590,Twilight,EDWARD,I'll give you a tour of the house.
17591,Twilight,BELLA,Graduation caps?
17592,Twilight,EDWARD,A private joke. We matriculate a lot.
17593,Twilight,BELLA,"What a nightmare, repeating high school."
17594,Twilight,EDWARD,"True, but the younger we start out in new place, the longer we can stay there."
17595,Twilight,EDWARD,... and this is my room.
17596,Twilight,BELLA,So you're obsessed with music. But.. No bed?
17597,Twilight,EDWARD,No sleep.
17598,Twilight,BELLA,Ever?
17599,Twilight,EDWARD,"No nightmares, no drool, no snoring."
17600,Twilight,EDWARD,Do you have any favorites?
17601,Twilight,BELLA,"Depends. Alternative? Jazz? Sixties, seventies.."
17602,Twilight,EDWARD,"Ooh, she knows her music. Alright, nineties. Eighteen-nineties. Classical."
17603,Twilight,BELLA,I'd have to say... Debussy.
17604,Twilight,EDWARD,"My favorite, too."
17605,Twilight,BELLA,No dancing.
17606,Twilight,EDWARD,Ever?
17607,Twilight,BELLA,"No tripping, no falling, no derision."
17608,Twilight,EDWARD,I can always make you.
17609,Twilight,BELLA,You don't scare me.
17610,Twilight,EDWARD,You really shouldn't have said that.
17611,Twilight,BELLA,Don't you dare -
17612,Twilight,EDWARD,Trust me?
17613,Twilight,BELLA,In theory.
17614,Twilight,EDWARD,Then close your eyes.
17615,Twilight,EDWARD,Open.
17616,Twilight,BELLA,Everyone's staring.
17617,Twilight,EDWARD,"Not that guy over -- yeah, he just looked. Off his rakish, but reassuring smile.."
17618,Twilight,BELLA,Sorry I'm late. Biology project.
17619,Twilight,BELLA,Order one for yourself next time. You should cut back on the steak.
17620,Twilight,BELLA,"Yeah, me, too."
17621,Twilight,BELLA,He's just a friend.
17622,Twilight,BELLA,"We're not really going to talk about boys, are we?"
17623,Twilight,BELLA,So spring training's going well?
17624,Twilight,BELLA,"Actually, Forks is kind of growing on me."
17625,Twilight,BELLA,Maybe..
17626,Twilight,BELLA,Well... he is kind of a history buff.
17627,Twilight,BELLA,"I, uh... have to go."
17628,Twilight,BELLA,"I'll call you later, Mom."
17629,Twilight,BELLA,How did you get in here?
17630,Twilight,EDWARD,The window. As always.
17631,Twilight,BELLA,You've been here before?
17632,Twilight,EDWARD,What else is there to do at night?
17633,Twilight,BELLA,You're a peeping Tom! Perv!
17634,Twilight,EDWARD,Shh! The Chief will hear you!
17635,Twilight,EDWARD,I just... like watching over you.
17636,Twilight,EDWARD,There's something I'd like to try.
17637,Twilight,BELLA,Oh... I'm... oh.
17638,Twilight,EDWARD,I'm stronger than I thought.
17639,Twilight,BELLA,Wish I could say the same. I'm so embarrassed.
17640,Twilight,EDWARD,Don't be. But we have to be careful. I can never lose control with you. Ever.
17641,Twilight,BELLA,I have a date with Edward Cullen.
17642,Twilight,BELLA,We're both juniors. I thought you liked the Cullens.
17643,Twilight,BELLA,"Edward doesn't live in town. And it's in the early stage and - whatever, he's outside right now."
17644,Twilight,BELLA,He wants to meet you. Officially.
17645,Twilight,BELLA,"Be nice, okay? He's... important."
17646,Twilight,EDWARD,Chief Swan. I wanted to formally introduce myself. I'm Edward.
17647,Twilight,EDWARD,I won't keep Bella out late tonight. We're just going to go play baseball with my family.
17648,Twilight,EDWARD,"Yes, sir, that's the plan."
17649,Twilight,EDWARD,"She'll be safe with me, sir, I promise."
17650,Twilight,BELLA,"No fair, reading Charlie's mind."
17651,Twilight,BELLA,And since when do vampires like baseball?
17652,Twilight,EDWARD,"It's the American pastime. Plus, there's a thunderstorm coming. It's the only time we can play. You'll see why."
17653,Twilight,BELLA,Now I get why you need the thunder.
17654,Twilight,BELLA,That has to be a home run.
17655,Twilight,BELLA,Yer out?
17656,Twilight,EDWARD,Put your hair down
17657,Twilight,EDWARD,I shouldn't have brought you here. I'm so sorry.
17658,Twilight,EDWARD,"James is a tracker. I saw his mind. The hunt is his obsession, and my reaction set him off -"
17659,Twilight,EDWARD,-- We're a large clan of strong fighters all protecting one vulnerable human.
17660,Twilight,EDWARD,The first place he'll go is your house. He'll track your scent there.
17661,Twilight,BELLA,"I said, leave me alone!"
17662,Twilight,EDWARD,"Bella, don't do this. Just think about it, please"
17663,Twilight,BELLA,Get out! It's over.
17664,Twilight,BELLA,I have to get out of this place. Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now.
17665,Twilight,BELLA,I can't hurt him.
17666,Twilight,BELLA,"No, Dad."
17667,Twilight,BELLA,I broke up with him.
17668,Twilight,BELLA,That's why I have to leave. I don't want this. I want to go home.
17669,Twilight,EDWARD,I'll be in the truck.
17670,Twilight,BELLA,She'll come home. I'll call her from the road.
17671,Twilight,BELLA,I want to drive. I need time to think. I'll pull into a motel in few hours. I promise.
17672,Twilight,EDWARD,He'll forgive you. Slide over..
17673,Twilight,BELLA,His face... I said the same words my mother used when she left him.
17674,Twilight,EDWARD,It was the only way he'd let you go.
17675,Twilight,EDWARD,"Your father's safe now, Bella. The tracker is following us"
17676,Twilight,EDWARD,It's alright. It's just Emmett. Alice is in the car behind us.
17677,Twilight,EDWARD,But not impossible. We'll tear him up
17678,Twilight,EDWARD,"I'll run Bella south, while you lead the tracker away"
17679,Twilight,EDWARD,Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?
17680,Twilight,EDWARD,"Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent."
17681,Twilight,BELLA,If any of you get hurt because of me
17682,Twilight,EDWARD,"We won't, there are five of us, two of them. When it's done, I'll come get you."
17683,Twilight,EDWARD,You're my life now.
17684,Twilight,BELLA,I wish he'd call.
17685,Twilight,BELLA,They could get hurt. It's not worth it.
17686,Twilight,BELLA,How do the visions work? Edward said they weren't always certain.
17687,Twilight,BELLA,So the course James is on now will lead him to... a ballet studio?
17688,Twilight,BELLA,No. I don't know. I used to take ballet lessons as a kid. The school had an arch like that.
17689,Twilight,BELLA,"Yeah, around the corner from my house. But I haven't been there in ten years."
17690,Twilight,BELLA,"No. Hell, no. I hated the place."
17691,Twilight,BELLA,Edward. Are you alright?
17692,Twilight,EDWARD,I'm coming to get you. (hates having to say
17693,Twilight,EDWARD,"Bella, we're in too deep. We can't change how we feel.."
17694,Twilight,BELLA,No... we can't. When will you get here?
17695,Twilight,EDWARD,In a couple hours. Then you and will go somewhere. Together. The others will keep hunting.
17696,Twilight,BELLA,"Mom, I'm so glad you got my -"
17697,Twilight,BELLA,"Calm down, Mom. Everything is fine, okay? I'll explain every"
17698,Twilight,BELLA,... Mom? Are you there?
17699,Twilight,BELLA,Leave my mother out of this.
17700,Twilight,BELLA,I... don't think so.
17701,Twilight,BELLA,Where should I meet you?
17702,Twilight,BELLA,"8th and Palo Verde, please."
17703,Twilight,BELLA,Everyone makes fun of me.
17704,Twilight,BELLA,"Mom, I suck."
17705,Twilight,BELLA,She's not here.
17706,Twilight,BELLA,Edward has nothing to do with this.
17707,Twilight,BELLA,"No! Edward, don't.."
17708,Twilight,EDWARD,I'm strong enough to kill you.
17709,Twilight,BELLA,It's on fire! My hand!
17710,Twilight,EDWARD,Venom -
17711,Twilight,EDWARD,No!
17712,Twilight,EDWARD,It doesn't have to be that way.
17713,Twilight,BELLA,It's burning!
17714,Twilight,EDWARD,What's the other choice? You said
17715,Twilight,EDWARD,I -- won't be able to stop
17716,Twilight,EDWARD,"It's alright, Bella. I'll make it go away."
17717,Twilight,BELLA,"Life... is harder.. An oxygen tube rests under her nose. She reaches for it, confused. A hand stops her as her surroundings come into focus. RENE (O.S."
17718,Twilight,BELLA,Edward? Where's -
17719,Twilight,BELLA,What... happened?
17720,Twilight,BELLA,Sounds like me.
17721,Twilight,BELLA,"Mom, you're... texting."
17722,Twilight,BELLA,That's great mom.
17723,Twilight,BELLA,"Mom, wait. I want to live in Forks. I have Dad.."
17724,Twilight,BELLA,What do you think?
17725,Twilight,BELLA,"Um, Mom, would you mind getting Dad? want to talk to him. Apologize."
17726,Twilight,BELLA,Is James - did you --
17727,Twilight,EDWARD,"We took care of him. And the woman, Victoria, she ran off."
17728,Twilight,BELLA,I'm alive because of you.
17729,Twilight,EDWARD,You're in here because of me.
17730,Twilight,EDWARD,The worst of it... was thinking couldn't stop -
17731,Twilight,BELLA,But you did.
17732,Twilight,EDWARD,"Bella, you should go to Jacksonville. Where I can't hurt you anymore.."
17733,Twilight,BELLA,What? No! I want to be with you! don't want
17734,Twilight,BELLA,You really are trying to kill me.
17735,Twilight,EDWARD,Prom is an important rite of passage. I don't want you to miss anything.
17736,Twilight,EDWARD,Shall we?
17737,Twilight,BELLA,You're serious.
17738,Twilight,EDWARD,See? You're dancing.
17739,Twilight,BELLA,At prom.
17740,Twilight,BELLA,"Edward... why did you save me? If you'd let the venom spread, I could've been like you by now."
17741,Twilight,BELLA,I want you. Always.
17742,Twilight,EDWARD,I won't end your life for you.
17743,Twilight,BELLA,"I'm dying anyway. Every minute, I get closer, older"
17744,Twilight,EDWARD,That's how it's supposed to happen.
17745,Twilight,BELLA,Not the way Alice saw it. I heard her. She saw me like you.
17746,Twilight,EDWARD,"Her visions change, Bella."
17747,Twilight,BELLA,Based on what someone decides. And I've decided.
17748,Twilight,EDWARD,Is that what you dream about? Becoming a monster?
17749,Twilight,BELLA,I dream about being with you forever.
17750,Twilight,EDWARD,You really want this?
17751,Twilight,BELLA,Yes.
17752,Twilight,EDWARD,You're ready right now?
17753,Twilight,BELLA,Yes.
17754,Twilight,EDWARD,You're going to have a long and happy life with me. Isn't that enough?
17755,Twilight,BELLA,For now.
17756,Twilight,BELLA,No one will surrender tonight. But I won't give in. I know what I want.
17757,Up,CARL,No!
17758,Up,ELLIE,"It's a beautiful day, winds out of the east at ten knots. Visibility... unlimited. Enter the weather in the logbook! The navigator skitters in its cage."
17759,Up,ELLIE,"Oh! There's something down there! I will bring it back for science. Awwww, it's a puppy!"
17760,Up,ELLIE,No time! A storm! Lightning! Hail! Ellie pops up in front of Carl.
17761,Up,ELLIE,What are you doing!?!
17762,Up,ELLIE,"Don't you know this is an exclusive club? Only explorers get in here. Not just any kid off the street with a helmet and a pair of goggles. Do you think you got what it takes? Well, do you?!?"
17763,Up,ELLIE,"Alright, you're in. Welcome aboard. She offers her hand. Carl looks down, embarrassed."
17764,Up,ELLIE,What's wrong? Can't you talk? Carl is frozen. Ellie softens.
17765,Up,ELLIE,"Hey, I don't bite. She takes off her helmet. Her hair frizzes out in all directions. She removes a homemade GRAPE SODA CAP pin from her shirt and pins it on Carl."
17766,Up,ELLIE,"You and me, we're in a club now."
17767,Up,ELLIE,"I saw where your balloon went. Come on, let's go get it!"
17768,Up,ELLIE,My name's Ellie.
17769,Up,ELLIE,There it is.
17770,Up,ELLIE,"Well, go ahead. She pushes him out onto the beam."
17771,Up,ELLIE,Go on.
17772,Up,CARL,Ow!
17773,Up,ELLIE,Hey kid!!
17774,Up,CARL,Ow!!
17775,Up,ELLIE,Thought you might need a little cheerin' up. I got somethin' to show ya!
17776,Up,ELLIE,I am about to let you see something I have never shown to another human being. Ever. In my life. Carl's eyes widen in alarm.
17777,Up,ELLIE,You'll have to swear you will not tell anyone. Carl nods.
17778,Up,ELLIE,Cross your heart. Do it! Carl crosses. Ellie unveils...
17779,Up,ELLIE,"My Adventure Book! It's a reused photo album with the words ""My Adventure Book"" written across it. She opens it to a photo of Charles Muntz."
17780,Up,ELLIE,You know him. Carl smiles excitedly.
17781,Up,ELLIE,"Charles Muntz, explorer. When I get big, I'm going where he's going: South America. She turns the page to a map."
17782,Up,ELLIE,It's like America... but south. Wanna know where I'm gonna live?
17783,Up,ELLIE,"""Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."" I ripped this right out of a library book."
17784,Up,ELLIE,"I'm gonna move my clubhouse there, and park it right next to the falls. Who knows what lives up there? And once I get there..."
17785,Up,ELLIE,"Well, I'm saving these pages for all the adventures I'm gonna have. Only... I just don't know how I'm gonna get to Paradise Falls. Ellie closes the book, disappointed."
17786,Up,ELLIE,That's it! You can take us there in a blimp! Swear you'll take us. Cross your heart! Cross it! Cross your heart.
17787,Up,ELLIE,Good. You promised. No backing out.
17788,Up,ELLIE,"Well, see you tomorrow kid! Bye."
17789,Up,ELLIE,"""Adventure is out there!!"""
17790,Up,ELLIE,"You know, you don't talk very much. I like you."
17791,Up,CARL,Wow.
17792,Up,CARL,"Quite a sight, huh Ellie? Uhp, mail's here."
17793,Up,CARL,Shady Oaks Retirement. Oh brother.
17794,Up,CARL,Hm.
17795,Up,CARL,No. Yes. Tell your boss over there that you boys are ruining our house.
17796,Up,CARL,I believe I made my position to your boss quite clear.
17797,Up,CARL,"Oh yeah, that was good. Here, let me talk to him."
17798,Up,CARL,"You in the suit. Yes, you. Take a bath, hippy!"
17799,Up,CARL,Tell your boss he can have our house.
17800,Up,CARL,When I'm dead! Carl SLAMS the door.
17801,Up,RUSSELL,"""Good afternoon. My name is Russell. And I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12. Are you in need of any assistance today, sir?"""
17802,Up,CARL,No.
17803,Up,RUSSELL,I could help you cross the street.
17804,Up,CARL,No.
17805,Up,RUSSELL,I could help you cross your yard.
17806,Up,CARL,No.
17807,Up,RUSSELL,I could help you cross your... porch?
17808,Up,CARL,No.
17809,Up,RUSSELL,"Well, I gotta help you cross something."
17810,Up,CARL,"Uh, no. I'm doing fine."
17811,Up,RUSSELL,"""Good afternoon. My name is Russell."""
17812,Up,CARL,Uh... kid...
17813,Up,RUSSELL,"""And I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12."""
17814,Up,CARL,Kid. KID!!
17815,Up,RUSSELL,"""Are you in need of any assistance today Sir?"""
17816,Up,CARL,"Thank you, but I don't need any help!"
17817,Up,RUSSELL,Ow.
17818,Up,RUSSELL,"""Good afternoon. My-"""
17819,Up,CARL,But skip to the end!
17820,Up,RUSSELL,"See these? These are my Wilderness Explorer badges. You may notice one is missing. It's my Assisting the Elderly badge. If I get it I will become a Senior Wilderness Explorer! Russell makes the Explorer Sign: his thumbs form a ""W"", his fingers the ""wings"" of a bird, then the ""claws"" of a bear."
17821,Up,RUSSELL,"""The wilderness must be explored!"
17822,Up,RUSSELL,"It's gonna be great! There's a big ceremony, and all the dads come, and they pin on our badges..."
17823,Up,CARL,So you want to assist an old person?
17824,Up,RUSSELL,Yep! Then I will be a Senior Wilderness Explorer! Carl leans in close to Russell.
17825,Up,RUSSELL,Snipe?
17826,Up,CARL,Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it sneaks in my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas. I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it. If only someone could help me...
17827,Up,RUSSELL,Me! Me! I'll do it!
17828,Up,CARL,"Oh, I don't know, it's awfully crafty. You'd have to clap your hands three times to lure it in."
17829,Up,RUSSELL,"I'll find it, Mr. Fredricksen!"
17830,Up,CARL,I think its burrow is two blocks down. If you go past --
17831,Up,RUSSELL,Two blocks down! Got it!
17832,Up,RUSSELL,Sniiiipe! Here Snipey Snipey...
17833,Up,CARL,Bring it back here when you find it! Carl rolls his eyes and begins to close his door.
17834,Up,CARL,What? Hey! Hey you! What do you think you're doing?
17835,Up,CARL,Don't touch that!
17836,Up,CARL,I don't want you to touch it! Carl HITS the worker with his cane. He falls to the sidewalk. The worker rubs his head. Blood.
17837,Up,CARL,"What do I do now, Ellie?"
17838,Up,CARL,Morning gentlemen.
17839,Up,CARL,Ready as I'll ever be. Would you do me a favor and take this?
17840,Up,CARL,I'll meet you at the van in just a minute. I... want to say one last goodbye to the old place.
17841,Up,CARL,So long boys! I'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls!
17842,Up,CARL,"We're on our way, Ellie. Carl kneels at the fireplace and plunks the balloon strings tied to the grate. He CHUCKLES and settles into his chair. He closes his eyes and smiles. SHADOWS move gently across the fireplace mantle."
17843,Up,CARL,Huh?
17844,Up,CARL,Hm.
17845,Up,RUSSELL,"Hi, Mr. Fredricksen. It's me, Russell."
17846,Up,CARL,"What are you doing out here, kid?"
17847,Up,RUSSELL,"I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch, but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse."
17848,Up,RUSSELL,Please let me in?
17849,Up,CARL,No.
17850,Up,CARL,"Oh, alright, you can come... Russell runs into the house past Carl."
17851,Up,CARL,...in.
17852,Up,RUSSELL,Huh. I've never been in a floating house before.
17853,Up,RUSSELL,Goggles. Look at this stuff! Russell finds Ellie's house drawing sitting on the pages of the open atlas.
17854,Up,RUSSELL,"Wow, you going on a trip? ""Paradise Falls: A Land Lost in Time."" You going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen? Carl takes the page and puts it in his pocket."
17855,Up,CARL,Don't touch that. You'll soil it.
17856,Up,RUSSELL,"You know, most people take a plane, but you're smart because you'll have all your TV and clocks and stuff. Russell runs over to the steering rig."
17857,Up,RUSSELL,Whoah. Is this how you steer your house? Does it really work?
17858,Up,CARL,"Kid, would you stop with the -- Russell steers and the house tilts, knocking Carl back and forth."
17859,Up,RUSSELL,"Oh, this makes it go right, and that way's left."
17860,Up,CARL,Let go of the -- knock it off! Russell looks out the window in front of him.
17861,Up,RUSSELL,"Hey look, buildings!"
17862,Up,RUSSELL,That building's so close I could almost touch it.
17863,Up,RUSSELL,"Wow! This is great! You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen! Look, there's a bus that could take me home two blocks away! Hey, I can see your house from here!"
17864,Up,CARL,"Don't jerk around so much, kid!"
17865,Up,CARL,"Well, that's not gonna work."
17866,Up,RUSSELL,"I know that cloud, it's a Cumulo Nimbus. Did you know that the Cumulo Nimbus..."
17867,Up,CARL,"Stayed up all night blowing up balloons, for what?"
17868,Up,RUSSELL,"...warm air goes by cool air, and the airs go by each other and that's how we get lightning."
17869,Up,CARL,"That's nice, kid."
17870,Up,RUSSELL,"Mr. Fredricksen, there's a big storm coming. It's starting to get scary. We're gonna get blown to bits! We're in big trouble, Mr. Fredricksen!"
17871,Up,CARL,What are you doing over there?
17872,Up,RUSSELL,Look!
17873,Up,RUSSELL,See? Cumulo Nimbus.
17874,Up,RUSSELL,My pack!
17875,Up,RUSSELL,Got ya!
17876,Up,RUSSELL,Whew! I thought you were dead.
17877,Up,CARL,Wha... what happened?
17878,Up,RUSSELL,I steered us. I did! I steered the house!
17879,Up,CARL,Steered us?
17880,Up,RUSSELL,"After you tied your stuff down you took a nap, so I went ahead and steered us down here."
17881,Up,CARL,Huh?
17882,Up,CARL,Can't tell where we are.
17883,Up,RUSSELL,"Oh we're in South America all right. It was a cinch, with my Wilderness Explorer GPS."
17884,Up,CARL,GP-what?
17885,Up,RUSSELL,"My dad gave it to me. It shows exactly where we are on the planet. With this baby, we'll never be lost! Russell gestures, tossing the unit out the window."
17886,Up,RUSSELL,Oops.
17887,Up,CARL,"We'll get you down, find a bus stop. You just tell the man you want to go back to your mother."
17888,Up,RUSSELL,"Sure, but I don't think they have busses in Paradise Falls."
17889,Up,CARL,"There. That ought to do it. Here, I'll give you some change for bus fare."
17890,Up,RUSSELL,"Nah, I'll just use my city bus pass."
17891,Up,RUSSELL,"Whoah, that's gonna be like a billion transfers to get back to my house."
17892,Up,RUSSELL,"Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?"
17893,Up,CARL,"Well, we're up pretty high. Could take hours to get down. Something flashes by them in the fog. Carl leans forward."
17894,Up,RUSSELL,"What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?"
17895,Up,CARL,We can't be close to the ground yet.
17896,Up,CARL,"Wait, wait! No don't, don't, don't!"
17897,Up,CARL,"Whoah! Hey, hey! Russell JUMPS onto Carl's leg and the extra weight pulls them to the ground."
17898,Up,CARL,"Russell, hang on! Carl and Russell slide toward the edge of a CLIFF EDGE."
17899,Up,RUSSELL,Whoah! They slide toward the edge... and stop. The drop is thousands of feet. Carl is TERRIFIED.
17900,Up,CARL,Walk back! Walk back!
17901,Up,RUSSELL,Okay!
17902,Up,CARL,Where... where are we?
17903,Up,RUSSELL,"This doesn't look like the city or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen. The wind picks up and they STRUGGLE against it."
17904,Up,CARL,"Don't worry, Ellie. I got it. The wind clears the fog, slowly revealing a crescent shaped, flat-topped mountain on which they stand."
17905,Up,CARL,"There it is. Ellie, it's so beautiful."
17906,Up,CARL,"We made it. We made it! Russell, we could float right over there. Climb up. Climb up!"
17907,Up,RUSSELL,You mean assist you?
17908,Up,CARL,"Yeah, yeah. Whatever."
17909,Up,RUSSELL,"Okay, I'll climb up!"
17910,Up,CARL,Watch it.
17911,Up,RUSSELL,Sorry. The hose jiggles as Russell CLIMBS out of frame.
17912,Up,CARL,"Now, when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up! Got it?!"
17913,Up,CARL,You on the porch yet?!
17914,Up,CARL,"What? That's it?! I came all this way just to get stuck at the wrong end of this rock pile? Aw, great!"
17915,Up,RUSSELL,"Hey, if I could assist you over there, would you sign off on my badge?"
17916,Up,CARL,What are you talking about?
17917,Up,RUSSELL,We could walk your house to the falls!
17918,Up,CARL,Walk it?
17919,Up,RUSSELL,"Yeah, after all, we weigh it down. We could walk it right over there. Like a parade balloon. Carl considers this."
17920,Up,CARL,"Now, we're gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly, with no rap music or flash-dancing. Russell inspects his surroundings."
17921,Up,CARL,"We have three days, at best, before the helium leaks out of those balloons. And if we're not at the falls when that happens..."
17922,Up,RUSSELL,Sand!
17923,Up,CARL,...we're not getting to the falls!
17924,Up,RUSSELL,I found sand!
17925,Up,CARL,"Don't you worry, Ellie. We'll get our house over there. Russell looks up at the house. Who's Carl talking to?"
17926,Up,RUSSELL,"Huh. This is fun already, isn't it? By the time we get there, you're gonna feel so assisted... Oh, Mr. Fredricksen, if we happen to get separated, use the Wilderness Explorer call. Caw caw, raaar!!"
17927,Up,RUSSELL,Wait. Why are we going to Paradise Falls again?
17928,Up,CARL,"Hey, let's play a game. It's called: ""See who can be quiet the longest."""
17929,Up,RUSSELL,Cool! My mom loves that game!
17930,Up,CARL,"Darn thing. C'mon, Russell, would you hurry it up?"
17931,Up,RUSSELL,I'm tiiiired. And my knee hurts.
17932,Up,CARL,Which knee?
17933,Up,RUSSELL,My elbow hurts and I have to go to the bathroom.
17934,Up,CARL,I asked you about that five minutes ago!
17935,Up,RUSSELL,"Well, I didn't have to go then! Russell goes limp and lies face down in the dirt."
17936,Up,RUSSELL,I don't want to walk anymore. Can we stop?
17937,Up,CARL,"Russell! If you don't hurry up, the tigers will eat you."
17938,Up,RUSSELL,There's no tigers in South America. Russell rolls over to show Carl a badge.
17939,Up,RUSSELL,Zoology.
17940,Up,CARL,"Oh, for the love of Pete. Go on into the bushes and do your business."
17941,Up,RUSSELL,"Okay! Here, hold my stuff."
17942,Up,RUSSELL,I've always wanted to try this!
17943,Up,RUSSELL,Mr. Fredricksen? Am I supposed to dig the hole before or after?
17944,Up,CARL,Eugh! None of my concern! Beat.
17945,Up,RUSSELL,Oh. It's before!
17946,Up,RUSSELL,Huh? Tracks?!
17947,Up,RUSSELL,"Here, snipe... Come on out, snipe. Snipe! The footprints continue for a time, then stop."
17948,Up,RUSSELL,Huh. Russell munches on a chocolate bar.
17949,Up,RUSSELL,Ha! Gotcha!
17950,Up,RUSSELL,"Don't be afraid, little snipe. I am a Wilderness Explorer so I am a friend to all of nature. Want some more?"
17951,Up,RUSSELL,Hi boy. Don't eat it all. Come on out.
17952,Up,RUSSELL,Come on. Don't be afraid little snipe. Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice... A massive shadowy creature rises up over Russell.
17953,Up,RUSSELL,...giant snipe!
17954,Up,RUSSELL,I found the snipe!
17955,Up,CARL,"Oh, did you?"
17956,Up,RUSSELL,Are they tall?
17957,Up,CARL,"Oh yes, they're very tall."
17958,Up,RUSSELL,Do they have a lot of colors?
17959,Up,CARL,They do indeed.
17960,Up,RUSSELL,Do they like chocolate?
17961,Up,CARL,Oh ye- Chocolate?
17962,Up,CARL,What is that thing?!
17963,Up,RUSSELL,It's a snipe!
17964,Up,CARL,There's no such thing as a snipe!
17965,Up,RUSSELL,But you said snipes eat--
17966,Up,RUSSELL,Whoah! Russell GIGGLES.
17967,Up,CARL,"Go on, get out of here. Go on! Shoo!"
17968,Up,CARL,"Careful, Russell!"
17969,Up,CARL,Russell! The bird grooms Russell.
17970,Up,CARL,"Get out of here. Go on, git!"
17971,Up,CARL,Aaaah!
17972,Up,RUSSELL,"Uh-oh! No no no no no Kevin, it's okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice!"
17973,Up,CARL,"""Kevin""?"
17974,Up,RUSSELL,"Yeah, that's his name I just gave him."
17975,Up,CARL,Hey. Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!
17976,Up,CARL,Hey! That's mine!
17977,Up,CARL,"Aaah! Shoo, shoo! Get out of here."
17978,Up,CARL,"Go on, beat it."
17979,Up,RUSSELL,"Can we keep him? Please?? I'll get the food for him, I'll walk him, I'll change his newspapers..."
17980,Up,CARL,No.
17981,Up,CARL,That doesn't even rhyme.
17982,Up,RUSSELL,Yeah it does. Russell points up to the roof of Carl's house.
17983,Up,RUSSELL,"Hey, look! Kevin!"
17984,Up,CARL,What? Get down! You're not allowed up there!
17985,Up,CARL,You come down here right now!
17986,Up,CARL,"Sheesh! Can you believe this, Ellie?"
17987,Up,RUSSELL,Ellie?
17988,Up,CARL,But I told him no -- I told you no! N-O. The bird HISSES at Carl.
17989,Up,CARL,I see you back there!
17990,Up,CARL,"Go on, get out of here. Shoo! Go annoy someone else for a while."
17991,Up,CARL,"Uh, hello?"
17992,Up,CARL,Oh! Hello sir! Thank goodness.
17993,Up,CARL,It's nice to know someone else is up here!
17994,Up,CARL,What? You can smell us?
17995,Up,CARL,Hey.
17996,Up,RUSSELL,You were talking to a rock. Russell points to another rock shape.
17997,Up,RUSSELL,"Hey, that one looks like a turtle!"
17998,Up,RUSSELL,"Look at that one! That one looks like a dog! The ""rock"" walks forward."
17999,Up,RUSSELL,It is a dog!
18000,Up,CARL,What?
18001,Up,RUSSELL,"Uh, we're not allowed to have dogs in my apartment. The dog nuzzles Russell, who nervously pets it."
18002,Up,RUSSELL,"Hey, I like dogs!"
18003,Up,CARL,We have your dog! Wonder who he belongs to?
18004,Up,RUSSELL,Sit boy.
18005,Up,RUSSELL,"Hey look, he's trained! Shake!"
18006,Up,RUSSELL,Uh-huh. Speak.
18007,Up,CARL,"Did that dog just say ""Hi there?"""
18008,Up,CARL,Uh..wha?
18009,Up,CARL,It's not possible.
18010,Up,RUSSELL,"Cool! What do these do, boy?"
18011,Up,CARL,"Russell, don't touch that. It could be radioactive or something. Dug sniffs the ground around Carl and Russell."
18012,Up,CARL,"Yes! Take it! And on the way, learn how to bark like a real dog!"
18013,Up,RUSSELL,Can we keep him? Please please please?
18014,Up,CARL,No.
18015,Up,RUSSELL,But it's a talking dog!
18016,Up,CARL,It's just a weird trick or something. Let's get to the falls.
18017,Up,RUSSELL,Hey Dug! Who you talking to?
18018,Up,RUSSELL,"Dug, stop bothering Kevin!"
18019,Up,CARL,I am not your master!
18020,Up,RUSSELL,Hey! Quit it!
18021,Up,CARL,Russell! At this rate we'll never get to the falls!
18022,Up,CARL,"I am nobody's master, got it? I don't want you here, ...and I don't want you here. I'm stuck with you. And if you two don't clear out of here by the time I count to three- Dug sees the tennis balls on Carl's cane."
18023,Up,CARL,Ball? Carl pops off one of the tennis balls.
18024,Up,CARL,You want it boy? Huh? Huh? Yeah?
18025,Up,CARL,Go get it!! Carl throws the ball far away. Dug chases after it.
18026,Up,RUSSELL,Why?
18027,Up,CARL,Just give it to me! Carl grabs some chocolate and waves it at the bird.
18028,Up,CARL,Bird. Bird! Carl THROWS the chocolate. The bird runs after it.
18029,Up,CARL,C'mon Russell!
18030,Up,RUSSELL,"Wait. Wait, Mr. Fredricksen."
18031,Up,CARL,Daah!
18032,Up,CARL,Aaahh...
18033,Up,RUSSELL,What are we doing?
18034,Up,RUSSELL,"Hey, uh, we're pretty far now. Kevin's gonna miss me."
18035,Up,CARL,I think that did the trick.
18036,Up,CARL,Afternoon. Carl turns the other way. The bird. It HONKS at him.
18037,Up,CARL,"Well, thanks for keeping us dry anyway, Ellie."
18038,Up,RUSSELL,Which one's the front?
18039,Up,RUSSELL,"Is this step three, or step five? Carl ROLLS HIS EYES at Russell's ineptness."
18040,Up,RUSSELL,"There! Russell struggles with a tent pole, trying to winch it into place."
18041,Up,RUSSELL,"All done. Russell turns, revealing a large RED WELT on his face."
18042,Up,RUSSELL,That's for you!
18043,Up,RUSSELL,Awh. Tents are hard.
18044,Up,CARL,"Wait, aren't you ""Super Wilderness Guy?"" With the GPM's and the badges?"
18045,Up,RUSSELL,"Yeah, but... can I tell you a secret?"
18046,Up,CARL,No.
18047,Up,RUSSELL,"Alright, here goes. I never actually built a tent before. There. I said it."
18048,Up,CARL,"You've been camping before, haven't you?"
18049,Up,RUSSELL,"Well, never outside."
18050,Up,CARL,"Well, why didn't you ask your Dad how to build a tent?"
18051,Up,RUSSELL,I don't think he wants to talk about this stuff.
18052,Up,CARL,Why don't you try him sometime? Maybe he'll surprise you.
18053,Up,RUSSELL,"Well, he's away a lot. I don't see him much."
18054,Up,CARL,He's got to be home sometime.
18055,Up,RUSSELL,"Well, I called, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much."
18056,Up,CARL,Phyllis? You call your own mother by her first name?
18057,Up,RUSSELL,Phyllis isn't my mom. Carl realizes he put his foot in it.
18058,Up,CARL,Oh.
18059,Up,RUSSELL,"But he promised he'd come to my Explorer ceremony to pin on my Assisting the Elderly badge, so he can show me about tents then, right?"
18060,Up,CARL,"Hey, uh, why don't you get some sleep. Don't want to wake up the traveling flea circus."
18061,Up,RUSSELL,"Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner. We have to protect him!"
18062,Up,RUSSELL,Can Kevin go with us?
18063,Up,CARL,Alright. He can come.
18064,Up,RUSSELL,Promise you won't leave him?
18065,Up,CARL,Yeah.
18066,Up,RUSSELL,Cross your heart?
18067,Up,CARL,Cross my heart.
18068,Up,CARL,"What have I got myself into, Ellie?"
18069,Up,CARL,Morning Sweetheart.
18070,Up,CARL,We better get moving.
18071,Up,CARL,"Huh. Bird's gone. Maybe Russell won't notice. Alright, everybody up!"
18072,Up,RUSSELL,"Where's Kevin? He's wandered off! Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!"
18073,Up,RUSSELL,"Oh, look! There he is."
18074,Up,CARL,"Hey, that's my food! Get off my roof!"
18075,Up,CARL,What is it doing?
18076,Up,RUSSELL,Her babies! Kevin's a girl? The bird gobbles the food and jumps off the roof.
18077,Up,RUSSELL,"Wait, Kevin's just leaving? But you promised to protect her!"
18078,Up,RUSSELL,"Her babies need her, we gotta make sure they're together."
18079,Up,CARL,Sorry Russell. We've lost enough time already.
18080,Up,RUSSELL,Yeah...
18081,Up,RUSSELL,"This was her favorite chocolate. Because you sent her away, there's more for you. Carl rolls his eyes and SIGHS."
18082,Up,CARL,Huh?
18083,Up,RUSSELL,Kevin?
18084,Up,CARL,"Wait, we're not going with you. We're going to the falls! Gamma and Beta BARK fiercely at Carl."
18085,Up,CARL,Get away from me! Get down!
18086,Up,CARL,Uh... yeah.
18087,Up,CARL,"Wait, are you Charles Muntz?!"
18088,Up,CARL,The Charles Muntz?
18089,Up,CARL,It's really him! That's Charles Muntz!
18090,Up,CARL,Him!
18091,Up,CARL,"I'm Carl Fredricksen. My wife and I, we were your biggest fans!"
18092,Up,RUSSELL,Uh-huh.
18093,Up,CARL,Wow.
18094,Up,CARL,"We're not actually going inside the ""Spirit of Adventure"" itself?!"
18095,Up,CARL,Would I?!?!
18096,Up,CARL,"Wait up, Mr. Muntz!"
18097,Up,CARL,Jiminy Cricket.
18098,Up,CARL,Did you ever! Will you look at that?
18099,Up,CARL,"Oh my gosh, the Giant Somalian Leopard Tortoise!"
18100,Up,RUSSELL,I liked his other voice. Muntz LAUGHS.
18101,Up,RUSSELL,Yes!! Russell is served a hot dog. His waiter can't resist and eats a bite.
18102,Up,RUSSELL,Hey!
18103,Up,RUSSELL,Hey!
18104,Up,CARL,"Oh my Ellie would have loved all this. You know, it's because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by Paradise Falls."
18105,Up,CARL,You're sure we're not a bother? I'd hate to impose.
18106,Up,RUSSELL,Hey!
18107,Up,CARL,No!
18108,Up,RUSSELL,"Hey, that looks like Kevin!"
18109,Up,RUSSELL,Yeah! That's my new giant bird pet. I trained it to follow us.
18110,Up,RUSSELL,She likes chocolate.
18111,Up,RUSSELL,"Yeah, I gave her some of my chocolate. She goes ga-ga for it."
18112,Up,CARL,But it ran off! It's gone now.
18113,Up,CARL,"Well! It's been a wonderful evening, but we'd better be going."
18114,Up,CARL,We don't want to take advantage of your hospitality. Come on Russell.
18115,Up,RUSSELL,But we haven't even had dessert yet.
18116,Up,RUSSELL,Kevin? Muntz walks to the window and looks out. Atop the roof he sees THE BIRD.
18117,Up,CARL,Hurry!
18118,Up,RUSSELL,I am hurrying!
18119,Up,RUSSELL,They're coming!
18120,Up,CARL,Russell!
18121,Up,CARL,Get back!! Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains down! The dogs stop short.
18122,Up,RUSSELL,Help! Help!
18123,Up,CARL,"Gimme your hand! Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl PULLS him back onto the bird. Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE. A river winds 100 feet below."
18124,Up,RUSSELL,Hang on to Kevin!
18125,Up,RUSSELL,Kevin!
18126,Up,RUSSELL,No no no! Kevin! Stay down. She's hurt real bad. Can't we help her get home?
18127,Up,CARL,Alright. But we've got to hurry.
18128,Up,CARL,See anything?
18129,Up,CARL,This is crazy. I finally meet my childhood hero and he's trying to kill us! What a joke.
18130,Up,CARL,"Careful Russell. The house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured BIRD on the porch."
18131,Up,RUSSELL,"You okay, Kevin? Kevin goes back to sleep. Russell looks at her BANDAGED LEG."
18132,Up,RUSSELL,"You know what, Mr. Fredricksen? The wilderness isn't quite what I expected."
18133,Up,CARL,Yeah? How so?
18134,Up,RUSSELL,"It's kinda... wild. I mean, it's not how they made it sound in my book."
18135,Up,CARL,"Hmm, get used to that, kid."
18136,Up,RUSSELL,"My dad made it sound so easy. He's really good at camping, and how to make fire from rocks and stuff. He used to come to all my Sweatlodge meetings."
18137,Up,RUSSELL,"And afterwards we'd go get ice cream at Fentons. I always get chocolate and he gets butter- brickle. Then we'd sit on this one curb, right outside, and I'll count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones, and whoever gets the most, wins. I like that curb. He looks up at Carl."
18138,Up,RUSSELL,"That might sound boring, but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most. They walk in silence. Carl understands."
18139,Up,RUSSELL,"Look, there it is!"
18140,Up,CARL,"Hold on Russell, stand still!"
18141,Up,CARL,Look at that bird go!
18142,Up,CARL,"Wait up, you overgrown chicken!"
18143,Up,RUSSELL,"That's it, go Kevin! Go find your babies!"
18144,Up,RUSSELL,Run Kevin! Run!
18145,Up,RUSSELL,Oh no!
18146,Up,CARL,"Russell, give me your knife!"
18147,Up,CARL,No!
18148,Up,RUSSELL,No! Carl pulls his house away from the flames.
18149,Up,RUSSELL,Let her go! Stop!
18150,Up,RUSSELL,Kevin! Carl beats out the flames with his jacket. He extinguishes the flames.
18151,Up,RUSSELL,You gave away Kevin. You just gave her away.
18152,Up,CARL,This is none of my concern. I didn't ask for any of this!
18153,Up,CARL,"I am not your master! And if you hadn't a shown up, none of this would have happened! Bad dog! Bad dog!"
18154,Up,CARL,"Now, whether you assist me or not, I am going to Paradise Falls if it kills me."
18155,Up,RUSSELL,"Here. Behind him, Russell throws his sash on the ground."
18156,Up,RUSSELL,"I don't want this anymore. Russell walks away. He sits on a rock, alone."
18157,Up,CARL,Russell?
18158,Up,CARL,Russell!
18159,Up,RUSSELL,I'm gonna help Kevin even if you won't!
18160,Up,CARL,"No, Russell! No! Carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift it. He struggles, but the house doesn't budge. The balloons have lost too much helium."
18161,Up,CARL,Wahhoo!
18162,Up,CARL,Russell?
18163,Up,CARL,Dug!
18164,Up,CARL,"Can you stay? Well, you're my dog aren't you? And I'm your master!"
18165,Up,CARL,"Good boy, Dug. You're a good boy!"
18166,Up,RUSSELL,Ooph!
18167,Up,RUSSELL,Yes! Don't worry Kevin! I'll save - Growling dogs move toward him.
18168,Up,RUSSELL,Let me go!
18169,Up,RUSSELL,He's not my friend anymore.
18170,Up,RUSSELL,Where are you keeping Kevin!?
18171,Up,RUSSELL,Let me go!
18172,Up,RUSSELL,I'll unleash all my Wilderness Explorer training!
18173,Up,RUSSELL,"Hey, where are you going? I'm not finished with you!"
18174,Up,CARL,Russell! Carl steers his house to the dirigible.
18175,Up,RUSSELL,Mr. Fredricksen!
18176,Up,CARL,"Dug! Bring `er over! Dug winches in the hose caddy, pulling the house closer to the dirigible ramp."
18177,Up,RUSSELL,You came back for Kevin! Let's go get her.
18178,Up,CARL,I'm getting Kevin. You stay here!
18179,Up,RUSSELL,But I want to help!
18180,Up,CARL,I don't want your help. I want you safe! Carl leaps back into the dirigible. Dug follows.
18181,Up,CARL,How do we get past these dogs?
18182,Up,CARL,Kevin!
18183,Up,CARL,"Don't worry Kevin, we're on our way! Alpha enters, leading a group of dogs. Carl and Dug duck into the shadows and watch unnoticed from above."
18184,Up,CARL,Who wants the ball?
18185,Up,CARL,Then go get it! Carl throws the ball. The dogs scramble after it.
18186,Up,CARL,I'm sorry Kevin. Let's get you out of here.
18187,Up,RUSSELL,I want to help! He manages to get his arms free.
18188,Up,RUSSELL,Ha ha!
18189,Up,RUSSELL,Whoooaaah!
18190,Up,CARL,"Come on, Kevin."
18191,Up,CARL,Come on!
18192,Up,CARL,"Come on, Kevin!"
18193,Up,RUSSELL,I can't do it!
18194,Up,CARL,Russell!
18195,Up,RUSSELL,Huh?
18196,Up,RUSSELL,You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!
18197,Up,RUSSELL,Hey! Squirrel!
18198,Up,CARL,"Dug! Dug jumps up on Carl, licking his face."
18199,Up,CARL,Russell!! Over here!! Let's go!
18200,Up,RUSSELL,Mr. Fredricksen!
18201,Up,CARL,"Come on, Kevin! Carl helps Dug onto the porch. He climbs up himself..."
18202,Up,CARL,No!
18203,Up,CARL,"Russell! Get out of there! Russell, Dug and Kevin run toward the front porch."
18204,Up,CARL,No! Leave them alone!
18205,Up,CARL,Russell! Hang on to Kevin! Don't let go of her!
18206,Up,CARL,Kevin! Chocolate!
18207,Up,RUSSELL,"That was cool! Russell and Dug dangle from it, sitting on Kevin. The bird holds on to the hose with her beak. Carl LAUGHS, relieved."
18208,Up,CARL,"Don't jerk around so much, kid! Russell climbs up, followed by the bird and Dug."
18209,Up,RUSSELL,"Sorry about your house, Mr. Fredricksen."
18210,Up,CARL,"You know, it's just a house. Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin stand on the tail of the airship floating off over the clouds."
18211,Up,CARL,Ow! Ow! Ow!
18212,Up,RUSSELL,Look at you. You're so soft.
18213,Up,RUSSELL,I wish I could keep one.
18214,Up,CARL,"Huh, where's my cane? I just had it here... Kevin starts HACKING. She COUGHS up the cane."
18215,Up,CARL,You know what? Keep `em. A little gift from me to you. The bird family enters the labyrinth. Carl and Russell wave.
18216,Up,RUSSELL,Bye Kevin! The bird looks back toward Carl and Russell and CALLS OUT one last time before disappearing into the mist.
18217,Up,RUSSELL,Ready? Carl gives a thumbs up.
18218,Up,CARL,Ready!
18219,Up,CARL,Excuse me. Pardon me. Old man coming through. Carl takes his place next to Russell.
18220,Up,CARL,I'm here for him.
18221,Up,CARL,"Russell, for assisting the elderly, and for performing above and beyond the call of duty, I would like to award you the highest honor I can bestow: The Ellie Badge."
18222,Up,RUSSELL,Wow.
18223,Up,RUSSELL,Blue one.
18224,Up,CARL,Red one.
18225,Up,CARL,Red one.
18226,Up,RUSSELL,That's a bike!
18227,Up,CARL,"It's red, isn't it?"
18228,Up,RUSSELL,"Mr. Fredricksen, you're cheating."
18229,Up,CARL,"No, I'm not. Red one."
18230,Up,RUSSELL,That's a fire hydrant.
18231,Up,CARL,Maybe I need new glasses.
18232,Wall-E,MARY,Date?! Don't get me started! Every holo-date I've been on has been a virtual disaster! If I could just meet one who wasn't so superficial. There are no good men out there!...
18233,Wall-E,MARY,...I know! I know `cause I've scrolled through them all -- What the --?
18234,Wall-E,MARY,Huh... ?
18235,Wall-E,MARY,M-mary.
18236,Wall-E,MARY,"Huh? Oh, uh, sure go ahead."
18237,Wall-E,MARY,I didn't know we had a pool!
18238,Wall-E,MARY,So many stars.
18239,Wall-E,MARY,"Oooh... Hey, that's what's his name --"
18240,Wall-E,MARY,Look! Look at THAT!
18241,Wall-E,MARY,"Right, Wall-E! Hi Wall-E!"
18242,Wall-E,MARY,Hi.
18243,Wall-E,MARY,Make me .
18244,Wall-E,MARY,"John, get ready to have some kids!"
18245,Wall-E,MARY,LOOK OUT!
18246,Wall-E,MARY,Oh no! Wall-E...
18247,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"She isn't coming yet, Toto. Did she hurt you? She tried to, didn't she? Come on - - we'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em. Come on, Toto."
18248,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Aunt Em! Aunt Em!
18249,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Aunt Em!
18250,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
18251,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --"
18252,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh -- oh, the poor little things. Oh, but Aunt Em, Miss Gulch hit Toto right over the back with a rake just because she says he gets in her garden and chases her nasty old cat every day."
18253,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week. And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --"
18254,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh -- all right.
18255,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Zeke, what am I going to do about Miss Gulch? Just because Toto chases her old cat --"
18256,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,I have so got brains.
18257,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all."
18258,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Well, gee, I try and have a heart."
18259,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,This?
18260,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh!
18261,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Hickory!
18262,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,I'm not afraid of her.
18263,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh!
18264,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh! Oh, Zeke! Help! Help me, Zeke! Get me out of here! Help!"
18265,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Yes, I'm all right. Oh -- I fell in and - - and Zeke --"
18266,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!"
18267,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto? She said she was gonna --"
18268,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,No --
18269,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Some place where there isn't any trouble.
18270,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto? There must be. It's not a place you can get to by a boat or a train. It's far, far away -- behind the moon -- beyond the rain --"
18271,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high, There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby."
18272,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,...Someday I'll wish upon a star And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
18273,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Destroyed? Toto? Oh, you can't! You mustn't! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! You won't let her, will you?"
18274,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Please, Aunt Em, Toto didn't mean to. He didn't know he was doing anything wrong. I'm the one that ought to be punished. I let him go in her garden. You can send me to bed without supper --"
18275,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,No --
18276,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, no, no! I won't let you take him! You go away, you....! Oooh, I'll bite you myself!"
18277,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto! Don't let her take him -- please!"
18278,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Stop her!
18279,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, don't, Uncle Henry. Oh, Toto! Don't..."
18280,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Toto, darling! Oh, I got you back! You came back! Oh, I'm so glad! Toto!"
18281,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, they'll be coming back for you in a minute. We've got to get away! We've got to run away -- quick!"
18282,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,How did you guess?
18283,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Why --
18284,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me."
18285,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?"
18286,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,...polite! We haven't been asked yet.
18287,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you."
18288,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
18289,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"No, they won't - honestly."
18290,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?"
18291,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,That's our farm!
18292,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Yes...That's Aunt Em.
18293,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,That's right. What's she doing?
18294,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh --
18295,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Me?
18296,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
18297,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,What's she doing now?
18298,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Has it poppies on the wall.... MCU - Professor - Camera shooting past Dorothy
18299,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,...paper?
18300,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, no -- no!"
18301,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, you...."
18302,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!"
18303,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right...."
18304,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"...away! Come on, Toto! Oh, what'll I do? If we go home, they'll send you to the Sheriff. And if we don't, Aunt Em may -- well, she may die! I know what I'll do - I'll give you to Hunk. He'll watch out for you. But we've got to hurry. Goodbye, Professor Marvel -- and thanks a lot!"
18305,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Auntie Em! Auntie Em!
18306,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"We're not on the ground, Toto!"
18307,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,We must be up inside.... MCS -- Toto looks out from under bed -- DOROTHY o.s.
18308,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Toto -- I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
18309,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,We must be over the rainbow!
18310,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Now I -- I know we're not in Kansas.
18311,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Who, me? Why, I'm not a witch at all. I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas."
18312,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Who, Toto?"
18313,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Toto's my dog.
18314,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, but I've already told you, I'm not a witch at all -- witches are old and ugly. What was that?"
18315,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"You are! Oh, I beg your pardon! But I've never heard of a beautiful.... MCU -- Glinda looks to r.f.g. and speaks -- DOROTHY o.s."
18316,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh. But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?"
18317,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,It really was no miracle. What happened was just this:
18318,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,I thought you said she was dead.
18319,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,No -- No! It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
18320,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh!
18321,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas? I can't go the way I came."
18322,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,The Wizard of Oz? Is he good or is he wicked?
18323,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"No, I'm afraid I didn't."
18324,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"But, how do I start for Emerald City?"
18325,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,But -- what happens if I --- CS -- Glinda speaks to Dorothy o.s. in f.g. --
18326,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,My -- ! People come and go so quickly here! Follow the Yellow Brick Road. Follow the Yellow Brick Road?
18327,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Follow the Yellow Brick Road? Follow the Yellow....?
18328,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Now which way do we go?
18329,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"That way is a very nice way. CS -- Scarecrow, his arm pointing to right --"
18330,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Who said that?
18331,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Don't be silly, Toto. Scarecrows...."
18332,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,...don't talk.
18333,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"It's pleasant down that way, too."
18334,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,That's funny. Wasn't he pointing the other way?
18335,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,...go both ways!
18336,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Why....
18337,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"...you did say something, didn't you? CS- The Scarecrow shakes his head, then nods -"
18338,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Are you doing that on purpose, or can't you make up your mind?"
18339,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,That's the trouble. I can't make up my mind. I haven't got a brain -- only straw.
18340,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,How can you talk if you haven't got a.... MCU -- Scarecrow speaks to Dorothy o.s.in f.g. -- DOROTHY o.s.
18341,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"I don't know. But some people without brains do an awful lot of talking, don't they?"
18342,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Yes, I guess you're right."
18343,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Well, we haven't really met properly, have we?"
18344,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Why, no."
18345,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,How do you do?
18346,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,How do you do?
18347,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Very well, thank you."
18348,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Oh, I'm not feeling at all well. You see, it's very tedious being stuck up here all day long with a pole up your back. MCU -- Dorothy --"
18349,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, dear -- that must be terribly uncomfortable. Can't you get down?"
18350,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Down? No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --"
18351,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, well, here -- let me help you."
18352,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind."
18353,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Well, oh, dear -- I don't quite see...."
18354,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Of course, I'm not bright about doing things, but if you'll just...."
18355,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh....
18356,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,...yes.
18357,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Ohhhh --
18358,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Ohh!
18359,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Whhhooops! Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
18360,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh -- does it hurt you?
18361,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again."
18362,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Ohhh --
18363,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"My, it's good to be...."
18364,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,...free!
18365,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh! Oh! Ohhh!
18366,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Did I scare you?
18367,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself."
18368,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,But I didn't scare you?
18369,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,No -- of course not.
18370,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,I didn't think so.
18371,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Boo! You see, I can't even scare a crow! They come from miles.... MCU -- Dorothy listening -- SCARECROW o.s."
18372,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Oh, I'm a failure, because I haven't got a brain."
18373,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Well, what would you do with a brain if you had one?"
18374,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Do? Why, if I had a brain, I could -- I could while away the hours, Conferrin' with the flowers, Consultin' with the rain. And my head I'd be scratchin' While my thoughts were busy hatchin' If I only had a brain. I'd unravel every riddle For any individ'le"
18375,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,With the thoughts you'll be thinkin' You could be another Lincoln If you only had a brain.
18376,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Oh, I could tell you why The ocean's near the shore I could think of things I never thunk before,"
18377,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,...Life would be a ding-a-derry If I only had a brain!
18378,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Gosh, it would be awful pleasin' To reason out the reason For things I can't explain. Then perhaps I'll deserve you, And be even worthy erv you If I only had a brain."
18379,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Wonderful! Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!"
18380,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,They would?
18381,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Um-hmm.
18382,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Where's Kansas?
18383,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,That's where I live. And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
18384,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,You're going to see a Wizard?
18385,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Um-hmm.
18386,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
18387,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"I couldn't say. But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now."
18388,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Yes -- that's true.
18389,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"But maybe you'd better not. I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble."
18390,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Witch? Huh! I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
18391,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,I don't blame you for that.
18392,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains. Look - - I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think. Won't you take me with you?"
18393,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Why, of course I will!"
18394,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Hooray! We're off to see a Wizard!
18395,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
18396,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Oh, I'll try! Really, I will."
18397,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,To Oz?
18398,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,To Oz!
18399,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh -- apples -- Oh look! Oh. Oh ---
18400,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Ouch!

18402,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas."
18403,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples. Hmm! MCU -- First tree reacts, and speaks --"
18404,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Oh, no! It's just that she doesn't like little green...."
18405,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Go -- Go!
18406,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,I'll show you how to get apples. TREE o.s.
18407,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Hooray! I guess that did it! Help yourself.
18408,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh --
18409,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Why, it's a man! A man made out of tin!"
18410,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,What?
18411,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Yes. Oh -- look --
18412,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Oil can.....Oil can....
18413,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Did you say something?
18414,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Oil can....
18415,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Oil can what?
18416,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oil can? Oh -- oh, here it is!"
18417,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Where do you want to be oiled first?
18418,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,My mouth -- my mouth!
18419,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,He said his mouth.
18420,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Here -- here --
18421,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,The other side....
18422,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Yes --- there.
18423,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Mm.....mm...mm....
18424,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,"...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows."

18426,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Oh --
18427,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"...Oh, did that hurt?"
18428,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,No -- it feels wonderful. I've held that axe up for ages. Oh ---
18429,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, goodness! How did you ever get like this?"
18430,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,"Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain...."
18431,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,"...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid. And I've been that way ever since."
18432,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Well, you're perfect now."
18433,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,My...my neck. My...my neck. Perfect? Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect. Go ahead -- bang on it!
18434,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh --!
18435,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Beautiful! What an echo!
18436,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
18437,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,No heart.
18438,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh --
18439,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,All hollow. Oh --
18440,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,"When a man's an empty kettle, He should be on his mettle. And yet I'm torn apart. Just because I'm presumin' That I could be kind-a human, If I only had a heart."
18441,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,I'd be tender -- I'd be gentle And awful sentimental Regarding Love and Art I'd be friends with sparrows...
18442,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,...And the boy who shoots the arrows If I only had a heart. Picture me....a balcony....Above a voice sings low.
18443,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,"I hear a beat....how sweet! Just to register emotion Jealousy -- Devotion -- And really feel the part, I could stay young and chipper, And I'd lock it with a zipper, If I only had a heart...!"
18444,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh --
18445,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?"
18446,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
18447,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, dear -- That was wonderful! You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart."
18448,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,"Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way."
18449,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
18450,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
18451,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,"Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?"
18452,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, but he will! He must! We've come such a long way already."
18453,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
18454,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"I'm not afraid of her. I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not! Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!"
18455,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,"I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not. Bee-hive -- bah! Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?"
18456,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Oh! They're - they're gone now.
18457,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?"
18458,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,"I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers."
18459,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!"
18460,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Oh - I'll get it!
18461,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh! Oh!
18462,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh --
18463,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,"Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!"
18464,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh-oh-
18465,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,It's only a man without a head who could do a thing like that. Poor little bee. CU - Dorothy reacts - reaches o.s. -
18466,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, there...."
18467,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,...there. Don't cry. There. CU - Dorothy looks o.s. - speaks -
18468,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"As a matter of fact, that's just an old drone bee, and it would have died.... CU - Tin Man looks o.s. - DOROTHY o.s."
18469,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Yes?
18470,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Oh.
18471,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
18472,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?"
18473,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,"No, sir!"
18474,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"No, sir!"
18475,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had! And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time. But I couldn't have, could I?"
18476,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"I don't see how. You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?"
18477,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
18478,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Still, I wish I could remember. But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway. We know each other now, don't we?"
18479,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,That's right.
18480,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,We do.
18481,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,To Oz?
18482,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,To Oz!
18483,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,I don't like this forest! It's -- it's dark and creepy!
18484,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter."
18485,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
18486,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,We might.
18487,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh --
18488,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Animals that -- that eat straw?
18489,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,"Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears."
18490,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Lions?
18491,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,And tigers?
18492,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,And bears.
18493,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh! Lions and tigers and bears!

18498,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, my!"
18499,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,And bears!
18500,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,What sort of an animal is that?
18501,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
18502,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"D-d-d-don't be fr-fr-frightened. I - I'll - I'll protect you. Oh, look!"
18503,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,Put 'em up! Put 'em....
18504,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,...up! Which one of you first? I'll fight you both together if you want! I'll fight you with one paw tied behind my back. I'll fight you standing on one foot.
18505,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,"I'll fight you with my eyes closed. Oh -- pulling an axe on me, eh? MCU -- Tin Man trembling --"
18506,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,"Sneaking up on me, eh? Why!"
18507,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
18508,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,"Oh, scared, huh?"
18509,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,"How long can you stay fresh in that can? Come on -- get up and fight, you shivering junk yard! Put your hands up, you lop-sided bag of hay!"
18510,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Now that's getting personal, Lion. MCU -- Tin Man looks o.s. -- speaks --"
18511,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Yes -- get up and teach him a lesson. MCS -- Scarecrow and Lion -- Dorothy in b.g. -
18512,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Well -- what's -- wrong with you teaching him?
18513,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,"Well -- well --, I hardly know him. CS -- Toto barking -- CU -- Lion snarls -- speaks"
18514,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,"Well, I'll get you, anyway, Pee-Wee. CU -- Dorothy reacts -- exits left f.g. --"
18515,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Shame on you!
18516,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,What -- what did you do that for? I didn't bite him.
18517,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"No, but you tried to."
18518,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --"
18519,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,"Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you? Is my nose bleeding?"
18520,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Well, of course not. My goodness, what a fuss you're making. Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!"
18521,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,You're right -- I am a coward.
18522,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,I haven't any courage at all. I even scare myself. Look at the circles under my eyes.
18523,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,I haven't slept in weeks.
18524,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Why don't you try counting sheep?
18525,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
18526,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Oh, that's too bad. Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?"
18527,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,I don't see why not. Why don't you come along with us? We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
18528,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,And him a brain.
18529,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,I'm sure he could give you some courage. MCU -- Lion -- Camera shooting past Dorothy --
18530,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,"Well, wouldn't you feel degraded to be seen in the company of a cowardly lion? I would."
18531,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"No, of course not."
18532,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,"Gee, that's -- that's awfully nice of you. My life...."
18533,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,...has been simply unbearable.
18534,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh.
18535,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,"Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --"
18536,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,I'd be gentle as a lizard --
18537,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,I'd be clever as a gizzard --
18538,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,If the Wizard is a Wizard who will serve.
18539,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Then I'm sure to get a brain --
18540,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,A heart --
18541,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,A home --
18542,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,The nerve.
18543,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,There's Emerald....
18544,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"...City! Oh, we're almost there at last! At last!"
18545,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"It's beautiful, isn't it? Just like I knew it would be. He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!"
18546,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,"Well, come on, then. What are we waiting for?"
18547,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Nothing! Let's hurry!
18548,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Yes -- let's run!
18549,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,Yes.
18550,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Come on -- come on --
18551,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Hurry -- hurry --
18552,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Oh! Oh, come on, come on!"
18553,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Look -- you can see it here. It's wonderful!
18554,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Emerald City!
18555,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh -- Oh -- what's happening? What is it?
18556,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,I can't run anymore. I'm so.... CS -- Tin Man and Scarecrow -- DOROTHY o.s.
18557,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"Here -- give us your hands, and we'll pull you...."
18558,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,...along.
18559,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, no -- please. I have to rest for just a minute. Toto!"

18836,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,I -- I didn't mean to kill her....really I didn't! It's...it's just that he was on fire!
18837,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"You mean, you're...you're all happy about it?"
18838,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,The broom!
18839,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,May we have it?
18840,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh -- thank you so much! Now we can go back to the Wizard and tell him the Wicked Witch is dead!
18841,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Please, sir. We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West. We melted her."
18842,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Yes, sir. So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir."
18843,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Tomorrow? Oh, but I want to go home now."
18844,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,You've had plenty of time already!
18845,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,Yeah!
18846,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!"
18847,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Who are you?
18848,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Who are you?
18849,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,You are?
18850,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,I don't believe you!
18851,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,You humbug!
18852,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,Yeah!
18853,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh ....
18854,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"...you're a very bad man! MCU -- The Wizard reacts, speaks humbly --"
18855,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,You'd better be good enough to send Dorothy back to Kansas!
18856,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,It makes you nervous?
18857,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,What about us?
18858,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
18859,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
18860,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,You don't get around us that easy!
18861,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,Not nohow!
18862,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,You promised us real things -- a real...
18863,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,...brain!
18864,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,Real courage. That's what we want.
18865,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Th.D.?
18866,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,"The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side. Oh joy, rapture! I've got a brain!"
18867,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,How can I ever thank you enough?
18868,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,"Oh -- Oh -- shucks, folks, I'm speechless!"
18869,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,But I still want one.
18870,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,"Ahh --- Oh, it ticks! Listen!"
18871,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Yes...!
18872,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,...yes.
18873,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Look -- it ticks!
18874,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,Read...read what my medal says.
18875,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,Courage!...
18876,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,...Ain't it the truth! Ain't it the truth!
18877,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
18878,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Hey -- what about Dorothy?
18879,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Yes -- how about Dorothy?
18880,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,Yeah.
18881,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,Dorothy next!
18882,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, I don't think there's anything in that black bag for me."
18883,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, will you? Could you? Oh -- but are you a clever enough Wizard.... MCU -- The Wizard -- DOROTHY o.s."
18884,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,It did?
18885,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Weren't you frightened?
18886,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Ohhh!
18887,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, come back here! Toto!"
18888,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Come back! Oh, don't go without me! I'll be right back! Toto!"
18889,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Stop that dog!
18890,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Oh! Help me! The balloon's going up!
18891,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Help!
18892,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh! Come back! Don't go without me! Please come back!
18893,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh --
18894,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, now I'll never get home!"
18895,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,"Stay with us, then, Dorothy. We all love you. We don't want you to go."
18896,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas. Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now. Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?"
18897,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Look -- here's someone who can help you!
18898,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, will you help me? Can you help me?"
18899,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,I have?
18900,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,Then why didn't you tell her before?
18901,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,"What have you learned, Dorothy?"
18902,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Well, I -- I think that it -- that it wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em -- and it's that -- if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again, I won't look any further than my own backyard. Because if it isn't there, I never really lost it to begin with! Is that right?"
18903,Wizard-of-Oz-The,SCARECROW,But that's so easy! I should have thought of it for you.
18904,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,I should have felt it in my heart.
18905,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Oh....
18906,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"...Toto, too?"
18907,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, now?"
18908,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye. I love you all, too. Goodbye, Tin Man. Oh, don't cry. You'll rust so dreadfully. Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye."
18909,Wizard-of-Oz-The,TIN MAN,Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
18910,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh -- Goodbye, Lion. You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage."
18911,Wizard-of-Oz-The,LION,Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
18912,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,I think I'll miss you most of all.
18913,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Yes. Say goodbye, Toto."
18914,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Yes, I'm ready now."
18915,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home.
18916,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,-- there's no place like home -- there's no place like home --
18917,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
18918,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!"
18919,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble. And I tried to get back for days and days."
18920,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,No --
18921,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,No. But it wasn't a dream -- it was a place. And you -- and you -- and you -- and you were there.
18922,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"But you couldn't have been, could you?"
18923,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place. And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice...."
18924,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"...but most of it was beautiful. But just the same, all I kept saying to everybody was, I want to go home. And they sent me home."
18925,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,Doesn't anybody believe me?
18926,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Oh, but anyway, Toto, we're home!"
18927,Wizard-of-Oz-The,DOROTHY,"Home! And this is my room -- and you're all here! And I'm not going to leave here ever, ever again, because I love you all! And -- Oh, Auntie Em -- there's no place like home!"
