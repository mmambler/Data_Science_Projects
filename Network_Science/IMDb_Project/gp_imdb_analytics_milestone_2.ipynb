        "\n",
        "This week I made a number of strides toward improving the methodologies and results of my data extraction. First and foremost, my main goal was to try to figure out the issue I was facing regarding the is_feature_film() function. I discovered that part of the problem was that occasionally the IMDb query would fail and not return any duration even when the ID passed did belong to a feature film. This problem would occasionally disappear however by rerunning the code at a later time. My plan for moving forward, in this regard, is to rewrite my code in such a way that, whenever a movie fails to load due to no duration info, it will not have to rerun through all the prior movies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, I have begun to address three other areas for improvement with my data extraction. First, I had built my code in such a way that it would create one giant json file as opposed to many smaller json files within file folders. For this reason, I have been adapting the code bit by bit so it doesn't build one large dictionary but rather creates new folders and fills those folders with json files by movie. Second, I have continued to transport my code from the Google Colab notebook I had written and tested it in, to a .py file that could be run in the terminal. As minor issues have arisen regarding differences between the notebook format and running the code in the command line, I have worked to fix them. Third, I have also been implementing more user-defined functions, rather than long, overly-nested chunks of code. This has made my code a lot cleaner and easier to work with.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moving forward, I will continue to progress in each of the areas I have addressed to this point. Ideally by the end of this next week, my ambition is to have a complete dataset ready for my groupmates that is easy to work with, includes all feature films, and is coded in a clean, readable formet. This way I can spend the following week assisting with problems with the data that arise from any of the other subtasks."
